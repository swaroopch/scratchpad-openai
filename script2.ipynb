       "['Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of RMS Titanic and stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The film also features Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, and Bill Paxton.\\nCameron\\'s inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success, and then received numerous accolades. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, Cameron\\'s direction, musical score, cinematography, story, and emotional depth. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve (1950) for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film.  With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron\\'s next film, Avatar, surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases since 1997 have pushed the film\\'s worldwide total to $2.254 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after Avatar). It was also selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 2017 for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 1996, aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, Brock Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS Titanic. They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find only a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the Titanic struck the iceberg that caused it to sink.  After viewing a television news story about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, identifying herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose aboard Keldysh, where she recounts her experiences as a Titanic passenger.\\nIn 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fiancé Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley, and Rose\\'s widowed mother Ruth, board the Titanic. Ruth emphasizes that Rose\\'s marrying Cal will resolve the family\\'s financial problems and maintain their upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class Titanic ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to commit suicide. Jack coaxes her back onto the deck and they develop a friendship. When Cal and Ruth strongly object, Rose rejects Jack\\'s attentions, but returns to him after realizing she has fallen in love.\\nRose brings Jack to her state room and requests he draw her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean. They later evade Cal\\'s servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in a Renault Towncar inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship\\'s collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers discussing its seriousness. Cal discovers Jack\\'s sketch and an insulting note from Rose in his safe, along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack\\'s pocket to frame him for theft. Jack is confined in the master-at-arms\\' office. Cal puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket.\\nWith the ship sinking, the crew prioritize women and children for evacuation. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they make it back to the deck, where Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat. Intending to save himself, Cal lies that he will get Jack safely off the ship and wraps his overcoat around Rose. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back onto the ship. Cal grabs Lovejoy\\'s pistol and chases Jack and Rose, but they escape; Cal realizes the necklace is still in the coat he gave Rose. He later poses as a lost child\\'s father to get onboard a lifeboat.\\nJack and Rose return to the deck. The ship\\'s stern is rising as the flooded bow sinks; the two desperately cling to the stern rail. The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section sinks. The remaining stern slams back onto the ocean, then upends again before it, too, sinks. In the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wood transom panel among the debris, buoyant enough only for one person, and makes her promise to survive. Jack dies of hypothermia, but Rose is among six people saved by the one returning lifeboat.\\nRMS Carpathia rescues the survivors. Rose avoids Cal and her mother by hiding among the steerage passengers and giving her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal\\'s overcoat, she discovers the necklace tucked inside the pocket. In the present, Rose says she later heard that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose\\'s story. Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep in her bed, her photos on the dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by her early conversations with Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the Titanic\\'s Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died that night.\\n\\nCast\\nFictional characters\\nKate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater: Cameron said Winslet \"had the thing that you look for\" and that there was \"a quality in her face, in her eyes,\" that he \"just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her\". Rose is a 17-year-old girl, originally from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father\\'s death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards Titanic with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, \"She has got a lot to give, and she\\'s got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [feels] that\\'s not going to happen.\" Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Gabrielle Anwar, and Reese Witherspoon had been considered for the role. When they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron\\'s attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as \"an Audrey Hepburn type\" and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, \"He\\'s great. Even if you don\\'t pick me, pick him.\" Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, \"From Your Rose\", and lobbied him by phone. \"You don\\'t understand!\" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. \"I am Rose! I don\\'t know why you\\'re even seeing anyone else!\" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.\\nLeonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said he needed the cast to feel they were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and \"to take that energy and give it to Jack, ... an artist who is able to have his heart soar\". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has travelled the world, including Paris. He wins two third-class tickets for the Titanic in a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight. Her fiancé\\'s invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. Cameron\\'s original choice for the role was River Phoenix, however he died in 1993. Though established actors like Matthew McConaughey, Chris O\\'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff were considered, Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested, but his asking price was too high. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. Jeremy Sisto did a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron\\'s attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene (see below). Cameron said, \"He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest.\" Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio\\'s acting ability and told him, \"Look, I\\'m not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I\\'m not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want.\" Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played by James Stewart or Gregory Peck. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled \"J. Dawson\". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, a trimmer in the engine room. \"It wasn\\'t until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone,\" said the film\\'s producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.\\nBilly Zane as Caledon Hockley: Caledon is Rose\\'s arrogant and snobbish 30-year-old fiancé, who is the heir to a Pittsburgh steel fortune. He becomes increasingly embarrassed by, jealous of, and cruel about Rose\\'s affection for Jack. The part was originally offered to Matthew McConaughey, and Rob Lowe has also gone on the record as having pursued it.\\nFrances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater: Rose\\'s widowed mother, who arranges her daughter\\'s engagement to Cal to maintain her family\\'s high-society status. Like many aristocratic passengers portrayed in the film, her disposition is elitist and frivolous. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage. She strongly dislikes Jack, even though he saved her daughter\\'s life.\\nGloria Stuart as Rose Dawson Calvert: Rose narrates the film in a modern-day framing device. Cameron stated, \"In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is [close to] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history.\" The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the \"Heart of the Ocean\" after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She shares the story of her time aboard the ship, and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role. Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, \"My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties.\" Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. \"But [Stuart] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [Winslet\\'s] spirit,\" stated Cameron. \"I saw this joie de vivre in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it\\'s the same person.\"\\nBill Paxton as Brock Lovett: A treasure hunter looking for the \"Heart of the Ocean\" in the wreck of the Titanic in the present. Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He later reflects at the film\\'s conclusion that, despite thinking about Titanic for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose\\'s story.\\nSuzy Amis as Lizzy Calvert: Rose\\'s granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns of her grandmother\\'s romantic past with Jack Dawson.\\nDanny Nucci as Fabrizio: Jack\\'s Italian best friend, who boards Titanic with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio fails to board a lifeboat when the Titanic sinks and is killed when one of the ship\\'s funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him and several other passengers to death.\\nDavid Warner as Spicer Lovejoy: An ex-Pinkerton constable, Lovejoy is Cal\\'s English valet and bodyguard, who keeps an eye on Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack rescuing her. He dies when the Titanic splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner had appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries S.O.S. Titanic.\\nJason Barry as Tommy Ryan: An Irish third-class passenger who befriends Jack and Fabrizio. Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.\\n\\nHistorical characters\\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events, the film includes portrayals of several historical figures:\\n\\nKathy Bates as Margaret \"Molly\" Brown: Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as \"vulgar\" and \"new money\". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered Lifeboat 6 from Quartermaster Robert Hichens. Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron\\'s film. Reba McEntire was offered the role, but had to turn it down, because it conflicted with her touring schedule.\\nVictor Garber as Thomas Andrews: The ship\\'s builder, Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the Titanic, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40 a.m. There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment. It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation.\\nBernard Hill as Captain Edward John Smith: Smith planned to make the Titanic his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the wheelhouse on the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when the windows implode from the water whilst he clings to the ship\\'s wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\".\\nJonathan Hyde as J. Bruce Ismay: White Star Line\\'s ignorant, boorish managing director, who influences Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this action appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence. After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his \"unsinkable\" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\\nEric Braeden as John Jacob Astor IV: A first-class passenger whom Rose (correctly) calls the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife Madeleine (Charlotte Chatton) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\\nBernard Fox as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV: The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don\\'t mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox had portrayed Frederick Fleet in the 1958 film A Night to Remember.\\nMichael Ensign as Benjamin Guggenheim: A mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a \"bohemian\". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.\\nJonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley: The ship\\'s bandmaster and violinist who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\", to the tune of Bethany, and dies in the sinking.\\nMark Lindsay Chapman as Chief Officer Henry Wilde: The ship\\'s chief officer, who lets Cal on board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.\\nEwan Stewart as First Officer William Murdoch: The officer who is put in charge of the bridge on the night the ship struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch\\'s nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle\\'s portrayal as damaging to Murdoch\\'s heroic reputation. A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a £5000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school\\'s William Murdoch Memorial Prize. Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the \"women and children first\" policy. According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an \"honorable man,\" not of a man \"gone bad\" or of a \"cowardly murderer.\" He added, \"I\\'m not sure you\\'d find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.\"\\nJonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water, and following the collision, suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\\nSimon Crane as Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall: The officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\\nIoan Gruffudd as Fifth Officer Harold Lowe: The ship\\'s only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\\nEdward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody: The ship\\'s only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following Murdoch\\'s orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\\nJames Lancaster as Father Thomas Byles: Second-class passenger Father Byles, a Catholic priest from England, is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship\\'s final moments.\\nLew Palter and Elsa Raven as Isidor and Ida Straus: Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, his wife Ida is offered a place in a lifeboat, but refuses, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\\nMartin Jarvis as Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon: A Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat\\'s crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife\\'s secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the Titanic was almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade\\'s inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon\\'s denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.\\nRosalind Ayres as Lady Duff-Gordon: A world-famous fashion designer and Sir Cosmo\\'s wife. She is rescued in Lifeboat 1 with her husband. They never lived down rumors that they had forbidden the lifeboat\\'s crew to return to the wreck site in case they would be swamped.\\nRochelle Rose as Noël Leslie, Countess of Rothes: The Countess is shown to be friendly with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the steerage passengers.\\nScott G. Anderson as Frederick Fleet: The lookout who saw the iceberg. Fleet escapes the sinking ship aboard Lifeboat 6.\\nPaul Brightwell as Quartermaster Robert Hichens: One of the ship\\'s six quartermasters and at the ship\\'s wheel at the time of collision. He is in charge of lifeboat 6. He refuses to go back and pick up survivors after the sinking and eventually the boat is commandeered by Molly Brown.\\nMartin East as Reginald Lee: The other lookout in the crow\\'s nest. He survives the sinking.\\nGregory Cooke as Jack Phillips: Senior wireless operator on board the Titanic whom Captain Smith ordered to send the distress signal.\\nCraig Kelly as Harold Bride: Junior wireless operator on board the Titanic.\\nLiam Tuohy as Chief Baker Charles Joughin: The baker appears in the film helping Rose stand up after she falls, following her and Jack to the ship\\'s stern, and finally hanging onto the ship\\'s railing as it sinks, drinking brandy from a flask. According to the real Joughin\\'s testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol. In a deleted scene, he\\'s shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle.\\nTerry Forrestal as Chief Engineer Joseph G. Bell: Bell and his men worked until the last minute to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out. Bell and all of the engineers died in the bowels of the Titanic.\\n\\nCameos\\nSeveral crew members of the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh appear in the film, including Anatoly Sagalevich, creator and pilot of the Mir self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle. Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film\\'s sets for the Titanic Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.\\n\\nPre-production\\nWriting and inspiration\\nJames Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks, and for him Titanic was \"the Mount Everest of shipwrecks\". He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had \"a mental restlessness\" to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. So when an IMAX film was made from footage shot of the wreck itself, he decided to seek Hollywood funding to \"pay for an expedition and do the same thing\". It was \"not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,\" Cameron said. \"I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.\"Cameron wrote a scriptment for a Titanic film, met with 20th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin, and pitched it as \"Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic\". Cameron stated, \"They were like, \\'Oooooohkaaaaaay – a three-hour romantic epic? Sure, that\\'s just what we want. Is there a little bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets, shoot-outs, or car chases?\\' I said, \\'No, no, no. It\\'s not like that.\\'\" The studio was dubious about the idea\\'s commercial prospects, but, hoping for a long-term relationship with Cameron, they gave him a greenlight.Cameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the Titanic wreck itself, and organized several dives to the site over a period of two years. \"My pitch on that had to be a little more detailed,\" said Cameron. \"So I said, \\'Look, we\\'ve got to do this whole opening where they\\'re exploring the Titanic and they find the diamond, so we\\'re going to have all these shots of the ship.\" Cameron stated, \"Now, we can either do them with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money – or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.\"The crew shot at the real wreck in the Atlantic Ocean twelve times in 1995. At that depth, with a water pressure of 6,000 pounds per square inch, \"one small flaw in the vessel\\'s superstructure would mean instant death for all on board.\" Not only were the dives high-risk, but adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting the high-quality footage that he wanted. During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with Titanic\\'s hull, damaging both sub and ship, and leaving fragments of the submersible\\'s propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of Captain Smith\\'s quarters collapsed, exposing the interior. The area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was also damaged.Descending to the actual site made both Cameron and crew want \"to live up to that level of reality ... But there was another level of reaction coming away from the real wreck, which was that it wasn\\'t just a story, it wasn\\'t just a drama,\" he said. \"It was an event that happened to real people who really died. Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it.\" Cameron stated, \"You think, \\'There probably aren\\'t going to be many filmmakers who go to Titanic. There may never be another one – maybe a documentarian.\" Due to this, he felt \"a great mantle of responsibility to convey the emotional message of it – to do that part of it right, too\".After filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay. He wanted to honor the people who died during the sinking, so he spent six months researching all of the Titanic\\'s crew and passengers. \"I read everything I could. I created an extremely detailed timeline of the ship\\'s few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life,\" he said. \"And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what I\\'d written and comment on it, and I adjusted it.\" He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californian\\'s role in Titanic\\'s demise, though this was later cut. From the beginning of the shoot, they had \"a very clear picture\" of what happened on the ship that night. \"I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially if we were going to dive to the ship,\" he said. \"That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you\\'d gone back in a time machine and shot it.\"Cameron was influenced in his crafting of the film by the 1958 British production A Night to Remember, which he had seen as a youth. He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes from that film, including the lively party of the passengers in steerage, and the musicians playing on the deck during the sinking of the ship.Cameron felt the Titanic sinking was \"like a great novel that really happened\", but that the event had become a mere morality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history. The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy, while the blossoming romance of Jack and Rose, Cameron believed, would be the most engaging part of the story: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss. He said: \"All my films are love stories, but in Titanic I finally got the balance right. It\\'s not a disaster film. It\\'s a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.\"Cameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant. While Winslet and Stuart stated their belief that, instead of being asleep in her bed, the character dies at the end of the film, Cameron said that he would rather not reveal what he intended with the ending because \"[t]he answer has to be something you supply personally; individually.\"\\n\\nScale modeling\\nHarland and Wolff, Titanic\\'s builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost. For the ship\\'s interiors, production designer Peter Lamont\\'s team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch. Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of seventeen million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunken by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was just steel plating. Within was a fifty-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60 foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by naval architect Jay Kantola utilizing plans of the Titanic\\'s sister ship RMS Olympic. Towering above was a 162-foot-tall (49 m) tower crane on 600 feet (180 m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.The sets representing the interior rooms of the Titanic were reproduced exactly as originally built, using photographs and plans from the Titanic\\'s builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard of authenticity, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on Titanic\\'s original designs. The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs. Cameron additionally hired two Titanic historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail in the film.\\n\\nProduction\\nPrincipal photography for Titanic began on July 31, 1996 at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the filming of the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale Titanic had been constructed. The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship\\'s stern rose during the sinking. For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber. By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot. Cameron chose to build his Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship\\'s departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912. Despite this, several critics picked up on anachronisms in the film, not least involving the two main stars.\\n\\nCameron sketched Jack\\'s nude portrait of Rose for a scene which he feels has the backdrop of repression. \"You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It\\'s kind of exhilarating for that reason,\" he said. The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet\\'s first scene together. \"It wasn\\'t by any kind of design, although I couldn\\'t have designed it better. There\\'s a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,\" Cameron stated. \"They had rehearsed together, but they hadn\\'t shot anything together. If I\\'d had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot.\" Cameron said he and his crew \"were just trying to find things to shoot\" because the big set \"wasn\\'t ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.\" After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.Other times on the set were not as smooth. The shoot was an arduous experience that \"cemented Cameron\\'s formidable reputation as \\'the scariest man in Hollywood\\'. He became known as an uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist\" and a \"300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people\\'s faces on a 162ft crane\". Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank in which the ship was to be sunk. \"There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn\\'t believe,\" she said. \"\\'God damn it!\\' he would yell at some poor crew member, \\'that\\'s exactly what I didn\\'t want!\\'\" Her co-star, Bill Paxton, was familiar with Cameron\\'s work ethic from his earlier experience with him. \"There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds,\" he said. The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him \"Mij\" (Jim spelled backwards). In response to the criticism, Cameron stated, \"Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.\"On August 9, 1996, during the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh shoot in Canada, an unknown person, likely a crew member, put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. It sent more than 50 people to the hospital, including Paxton. \"There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics,\" said actor Lewis Abernathy. Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. \"One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he\\'d been sniffing glue since he was four.\" The Nova Scotia Department of Health confirmed that the soup had contained PCP on August 27, and the Halifax Regional Police Service announced a criminal investigation the next day. The investigation was closed in February 1999. The person behind the poisoning was never caught.\\nThe filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160 (officially wrapped on March 23, 1997). Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned \"a lot of money\". Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set. Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming. Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:I\\'m demanding, and I\\'m demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there\\'s an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.\\nThe costs of filming Titanic eventually began to mount and finally reached $200 million, a bit over $1 million per minute of screen time. Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You\\'re going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You\\'re going to have to kill me!\" The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron\\'s offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely. Worried about surmounting costs, Fox wanted to find a partner studio to co-finance the film; Fox approached Paramount Pictures in May 1996, and the two studios agreed to split the costs and distribution rights. Fox retained the international distribution rights and sold the domestic rights to Paramount in return for $65 million, in an effort to recoup their investment.Cameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"... the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than T2 and True Lies. Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. Titanic also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that\\'s writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn\\'t force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"\\n\\nPost-production\\nEffects\\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects with his film, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology which the director pioneered while working on The Abyss and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Many previous films about Titanic shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing. Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14 m) miniature of the ship as if \"we\\'re making a commercial for the White Star Line\". Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot-long (20 m) model of the ship\\'s stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water. For scenes set in the ship\\'s engines, footage of the SS Jeremiah O\\'Brien\\'s engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen. In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors. The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.\\n\\nAn enclosed 5,000,000-US-gallon (19,000,000 L) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000 US gallons (340,000 L) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot-long (227 m) exterior of Titanic had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett\\'s ROV traversing the wreck in the present. The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000-US-gallon (1,300,000 L) tank, where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.The climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous Titanic films for depicting the liner\\'s final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\". When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer-generated people for the dangerous falls\".A Linux-based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects.\\n\\nEditing\\nThere was one \"crucial historical fact\" Cameron chose to omit from the film – the SS Californian was close to the Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew\\'s SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. \"Yes, the [SS] Californian. That wasn\\'t a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film,\" stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. \"The story of the Californian was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set,\" said Cameron. \"But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\"During the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the planned ending, which had given resolution to Brock Lovett\\'s story. In the original version of the ending, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose then reveals that she had the \"Heart of the Ocean\" diamond all along but never sold it, in order to live on her own without Cal\\'s money. She tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean, after allowing him to hold it. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. Rose then goes back to her cabin to sleep, whereupon the film ends in the same way as the final version. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the resolution to his story, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience\\'s melancholy after the Titanic\\'s sinking. Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock\\'s epiphany and laugh was unnecessary, stating that \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ... you didn\\'t really need anything from us. Our job was done by then ... If you\\'re smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you\\'ll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need\".The version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy which takes place after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon, but the test audiences disliked it. The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and featured Cal (falsely) offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the \"Heart of the Ocean\" if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Just as they are about to escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose\\'s hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the \"theft\" of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy\\'s head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one\\'s life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.\\n\\nHeart of the Ocean\\nFor the Heart of the Ocean design, London-based jewelers Asprey & Garrard used cubic zirconias set in white gold to create an Edwardian-style necklace to be used as a prop in the film. Asprey & Garrard produced and designed the necklaces: the result was three different and unique designs. Two of their designs were used in the film while the other went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace, and the Asprey necklace. The three necklaces are all very similar but have distinguishable differences.\\nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film\\'s success, Asprey & Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, 171-carat (34.2 g) heart-shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 103 diamonds. This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to Sotheby\\'s auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California\\'s Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client for $1.4 million, under the agreement that Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony. This necklace has since not been made available for public viewing.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nCameron wrote Titanic while listening to the work of Irish new-age musician Enya. He offered Enya the chance to compose for the film, but she declined. Cameron instead chose James Horner to compose the film\\'s score. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on Aliens, but Titanic cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner\\'s death. For the vocals heard throughout the film, subsequently described by Earle Hitchner of The Wall Street Journal as \"evocative\", Horner chose Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as \"Sissel\". Horner knew Sissel from her album Innerst i sjelen, and he particularly liked how she sang \"Eg veit i himmerik ei borg\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\"). He had tried twenty-five or thirty singers before he finally chose Sissel as the voice to create specific moods within the film.Horner additionally wrote the song \"My Heart Will Go On\" in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs with singing in the film. Céline Dion agreed to record a demo with the persuasion of her husband René Angélil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for \"going commercial at the end of the movie\". Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and \"saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion\".\\n\\nRelease\\nInitial screening\\nDistribution for the film was split between Paramount and Fox; the former handling the distribution in the United States and Canada, and the latter handling the international release. Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997. The film was to be released on this date \"to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better\". In April, Cameron said the film\\'s special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film for summer would not be possible. With production delays, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997. \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 \"generated positive reviews\" and \"[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]\". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.Cameron refused to hold the film\\'s world premiere in Los Angeles. Paramount disagreed with Cameron\\'s decision, but Fox acquiesced and went ahead and held the premiere on November 1, 1997, at the Tokyo International Film Festival, where reaction was described as \"tepid\" by The New York Times. Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where \"the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media\".\\n\\nBox office\\nIncluding revenue from the 2012, 2017 and 2023 reissues, Titanic earned $674.3 million in North America and $1.580 billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.254 billion. It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, beating Jurassic Park (1993). The film remained so for twelve years, until Avatar (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010. On March 1, 1998, it became the first film to earn more than $1 billion worldwide and on the weekend April 13–15, 2012—a century after the original vessel\\'s foundering, Titanic became the second film to cross the $2 billion threshold during its 3D re-release. Box Office Mojo estimates that Titanic is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation. The site also estimates that the film sold over 128 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.Titanic was the first foreign-language film to succeed in India, which claims to have the largest movie-going audience in the world. A Hindustan Times report attributes this to the film\\'s similarities and shared themes with most Bollywood films.\\n\\nInitial theatrical run\\nThe film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of Mouse Hunt, Scream 2 and the eighteenth James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies. It would go on to surpass The Godfather Part III\\'s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2 million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6 million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing Scream 2. By New Year\\'s Day, Titanic had made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300 million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held by Jurassic Park, which took 67 days to do so. Titanic would hold this record until 1999 when it was taken by Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. Its highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut. On March 14, it surpassed Star Wars as the highest-grossing film ever in North America. It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film. By April 1998, the film\\'s number one spot would be overtaken by Lost in Space, dropping into second place. The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998, with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188, equivalent to $1014.2  million in 2021. Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080 and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.\\n\\nCommercial analysis\\nBefore Titanic\\'s release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time. When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\", since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs – because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\". Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming. \"We labored the last six months on Titanic in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty,\" he stated. As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\". A film critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Cameron\\'s overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\".\\n\\nWhen the film became a success, with an unprecedented box-office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers\\' emotions. The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened, and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million for each of its first 10 weekends, and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million on weekdays. 20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen Titanic twice by its fifth week. Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused \"Leo-Mania\" were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record, other reports have attributed the film\\'s success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects. The Hollywood Reporter estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of $487 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.4 billion, with a modern profit of as much as $4 billion after ancillary sources.Titanic\\'s impact on men has also been especially credited. It is considered one of the films that make men cry, with MSNBC\\'s Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack\\'s sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose, which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack. The film\\'s ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 film Zombieland, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: \"I haven\\'t cried like that since Titanic.\"In 2010, the BBC analyzed the stigma over men crying during Titanic and films in general. \"Middle-aged men are not \\'supposed\\' to cry during movies,\" stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of Titanic as having generated such tears, adding that \"men, if they have felt weepy during [this film], have often tried to be surreptitious about it.\" Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, \"For many men, there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of \\'female\\' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren\\'t followed.\" Rohrer said, \"Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during Titanic will readily admit to becoming choked up during Saving Private Ryan or Platoon.\" For men in general, \"the idea of sacrifice for a \\'brother\\' is a more suitable source of emotion\".Scott Meslow of The Atlantic stated while Titanic initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film \"for 15-year-old girls\" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing Titanic as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film\\'s accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like Iron Man, it is common for boys and men to deny liking Titanic. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It\\'s this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) Titanic an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"Titanic has flaws, but for all its legacy, it\\'s better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It\\'s a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not a great movie for everyone else too.\"Quotes in the film aided its popularity. Titanic\\'s catchphrase \"I\\'m the king of the world!\" became one of the film industry\\'s more popular quotations. According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. \"People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh\", he said.Cameron explained the film\\'s success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. \"When people have an experience that\\'s very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,\" he said. \"They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That\\'s how Titanic worked.\" Media Awareness Network stated, \"The normal\\nrepeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for Titanic was over 20%.\" The box office receipts \"were even more impressive\" when factoring in \"the film\\'s 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie\\'s four showings\". In response to this, \"[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30 am\".Titanic held the record for box office gross for 12 years. Cameron\\'s follow-up film, Avatar, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross, and did so in 2010. Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge Titanic were given. For one, \"Two-thirds of Titanic\\'s haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [tracked] similarly ... Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before. Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while Avatar may beat Titanic\\'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\" In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don\\'t think it\\'s realistic to try to topple Titanic off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. Titanic just struck some kind of chord.\" In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once Avatar\\'s performance was easier to predict. \"It\\'s gonna happen. It\\'s just a matter of time,\" he said.Author Alexandra Keller, when analyzing Titanic\\'s success, stated that scholars could agree that the film\\'s popularity \"appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns of consumerism and globalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s – awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.\"\\n\\nCritical reception\\nInitial\\nTitanic garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film\\'s cultural, historical, and political impacts. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 250 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\" Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.With regard to the film\\'s overall design, Roger Ebert stated: \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding ... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well.\" He credited the \"technical difficulties\" with being \"so daunting that it\\'s a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion\" and \"found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga\". He named it his ninth best film of 1997. On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received \"two thumbs up\" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship\\'s sinking; Ebert described the film as \"a glorious Hollywood epic\" and \"well worth the wait,\" and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio \"captivating\".James Berardinelli stated: \"Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don\\'t just watch Titanic, you experience it.\" It was named his second best film of 1997. Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded: \"To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron\\'s recreation of the 1912 sinking of the \\'unsinkable\\' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.\"The romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of Urban Cinefile said: \"You will walk out of Titanic not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described the film as \"a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that \"Cameron\\'s magnificent Titanic is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to Gone With the Wind.\" Adrian Turner of Radio Times awarded it four stars out of five, stating \"Cameron\\'s script wouldn\\'t have sustained Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh for 80 minutes, but, somehow, he and his magical cast revive that old-style studio gloss for three riveting hours. Titanic is a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment. And there are single shots, such as an awesome albatross-like swoop past the steaming ship, when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all.\"Titanic suffered backlash in addition to its success. Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular, the story and dialogue were weak. Richard Corliss of Time magazine wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements. Kenneth Turan\\'s review in the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, \"What really brings on the tears is Cameron\\'s insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close\", and later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total. Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner gave Titanic one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, \"The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.\"\\n\\nRetrospective\\nAccording to Dalin Rowell of /Film, \"With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, Titanic is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\" In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I\\'ve ever seen in my entire life\". Similarly, French New Wave director and former Cahiers du Cinéma editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as \"garbage\" in a 1998 interview with Frédéric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet\\'s performance, who he said was \"unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.\" In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\", but it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as \"the worst movie of all time\". In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, \"Cameron\\'s film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered\". The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers\\' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings. In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. \"What really irks me ...,\" he said, \"are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.\" Willcock stated, \"I obviously don\\'t have anything against those who dislike Titanic, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.\"In 1998, Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan\\'s review in particular, by writing \"Titanic is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off. They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion.\" Cameron emphasized that people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were \"celebrating their own essential humanity\" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally \"incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric\" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. \"Turan mistakes archetype for cliché,\" he said. \"I don\\'t share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.\"In 2000, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that \"the critical knives were out long before James Cameron\\'s Titanic was complete. Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the 20th Century, and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release. But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong.\" He added that \"the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy\" and that \"when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron\". Empire eventually reinstated its original five-star rating of the film, commenting: \"It should be no surprise[,] then[,] that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron\\'s Titanic at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet\\'s favourite film. Ever.\"In 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It was listed among the 100 best films in an Empire poll and in a later poll of members of the film industry. In 2021, Dalin Rowell of /Film ranked it the third-best film of Cameron\\'s career, stating that it is \"easily one of his best films, simply because it defied the odds\", and considering it \"a legitimately remarkable achievement — one that, despite its large budget, has a humble, earnest center. Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way, Titanic demonstrates that Cameron is truly capable of everything he can imagine.\"\\n\\nAccolades\\nTitanic began its awards sweep starting with the Golden Globes, winning four: Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were also nominees. The film garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz\\'s All About Eve and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the Titanic to win that award, after 1933\\'s Cavalcade), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song. Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart and the make-up artists were the three nominees that did not win, ultimately losing to Helen Hunt in As Good as It Gets, Kim Basinger in L.A. Confidential and Men in Black simultaneously. James Cameron\\'s original screenplay and Leonardo DiCaprio were not nominees. It was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after Ben-Hur. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King would also match this record in 2004.Titanic won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The film\\'s soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, and became a worldwide success, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone. The soundtrack also became the best-selling album of 1998 in the U.S. \"My Heart Will Go On\" won the Grammy Awards for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.\\nThe film also won various awards outside the United States, including the Awards of the Japanese Academy as the Best Foreign Film of the Year. Titanic eventually won nearly ninety awards and had an additional forty-seven nominations from various award-giving bodies around the world. Additionally, the book about the making of the film was at the top of The New York Times\\' bestseller list for several weeks, \"the first time that such a tie-in book had achieved this status\".Since its release, Titanic has appeared on the American Film Institute\\'s award-winning 100 Years ... series. So far, it has ranked on the following six lists:\\n\\nHome media\\nTitanic was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998. More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film. Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million becoming the best selling live-action video, beating Independence Day. In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outselling The Lion King for a total worldwide revenue of $995 million. By March 2005, the film has sold 8 million DVD and 59 million VHS units. In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1 million copies on its first day of release, making it the country\\'s fastest-selling home video release. It would hold this record until it was surpassed by Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2 million home video units during its first day. Within the first week of release, Titanic quickly beat The Full Monty, selling a total of 1.8 million home video copies.A DVD version was released on August 31, 1999, in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than a theatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies. At the time, less than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. \"When we released the original Titanic DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,\" said Meagan Burrows, Paramount\\'s president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film\\'s DVD performance even more impressive.Titanic was re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005, when a three-disc Special Collector\\'s Edition was made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, a 6.1 DTS-ES Discrete surround sound mix and various special features. In PAL regions, two-disc and four-disc variants were released, marketed as the Special Edition and Deluxe Collector\\'s Edition respectively. They were released in the United Kingdom on November 7, 2005. A limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title Deluxe Limited Edition, was also only released in the United Kingdom with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron\\'s documentary Ghosts of the Abyss, which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release of Ghosts of the Abyss, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set. In 2007, for the film\\'s tenth anniversary, a 10th Anniversary Edition was released on DVD, which consists of the first two discs from the three-disc 2005 set containing the movie and the special features on those discs.The film was released on Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on September 10, 2012. The 3D presentation of the film is split over two discs and is also THX-certified. Special features on another disc included many of those featured on the 2005 Special Collector\\'s Edition DVD along with two new documentaries titled \"Reflections on Titanic\" and \"Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron.\" The latter aired on National Geographic on April 9, 2012 and was executively produced by Cameron.\\n\\nRe-releases\\n3D conversion\\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The Titanic 3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration. The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D. Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process. The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose\\'s view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the scene for showing an unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send film director Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.\\n\\nThe 3D version of Titanic premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on March 27, 2012, with James Cameron and Kate Winslet in attendance, and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days shy of the centenary of Titanic embarking on her maiden voyage.Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers rated the reissue 3+1⁄2 stars out of 4, explaining he found it \"pretty damn dazzling\". He said, \"The 3D intensifies Titanic. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, \"For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don\\'t look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.\" Richard Corliss of Time, who was very critical in 1997, remained in the same mood: \"I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged.\" In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the \"careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.\" Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post found herself asking \"whether the film\\'s twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron\\'s 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren\\'t.\" She further added that the \"3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.\"The film grossed an estimated $4.7 million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3 million over the weekend, finishing in third place behind The Hunger Games and American Reunion. Outside North America it earned $35.2 million, finishing second, and it improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9 million. China has proven to be its most successful territory, where it earned $11.6 million on its opening day, going on to earn a record-breaking $67 million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run. The reissue ultimately earned $343.4 million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8 million from Canada and the United States.With a worldwide box office of nearly $350 million, the 3D re-release of Titanic remains the highest grossing re-released film of all time, ahead of The Lion King, Star Wars, and Avatar.The 3D conversion of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film\\'s environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.\\n\\n20th anniversary\\nFor the 20th anniversary of the film, Titanic was re-released in cinemas in Dolby Vision (in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.\\n\\n25th anniversary\\nTitanic was re-released in theaters by Paramount domestically and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (through the 20th Century Studios label) internationally on February 10, 2023, in a remastered 3D 4K HDR render, with high frame rate, as part of the film\\'s 25th anniversary.

       " 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (transl.\\u2009\"The Big-Hearted Will Take the Bride\"), also known by the initialism DDLJ, is a 1995 Indian Hindi-language musical romance film written and directed by Aditya Chopra in his directorial debut and produced by his father Yash Chopra. Released on 20 October 1995, the film stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. The plot revolves around Raj and Simran, two young non-resident Indians, who fall in love during a vacation through Europe with their friends. Raj tries to win over Simran\\'s family so the couple can marry, but Simran\\'s father has long since promised her hand to his friend\\'s son. The film was shot in India, London, and Switzerland, from September 1994 to August 1995.\\nWith an estimated total gross of ₹2 billion ($60 million) worldwide, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was the highest-grossing Indian film of 1995 and one of the most successful Indian films in history. It won 10 Filmfare Awards—the most for a single film at that time—and the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Its soundtrack album became one of the most popular of the 1990s.\\nMany critics praised the film, which connected with different segments of society by simultaneously promoting strong family values and the following of one\\'s own heart. Its success led other filmmakers to target the non-resident Indian audience, which was deemed more lucrative for them. It spawned many imitations of its story and style and homages to specific scenes. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was one of only three Hindi films in the reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and was placed twelfth on the British Film Institute\\'s list of top Indian films of all time. In 2012, the film was included by critics Rachel Dwyer and Sanam Hasan in the 2012 British Film Institute Sight & Sound 1000 greatest films of all time. It is considered as the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema due to that fact that it is still being shown in a cinema called Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai as of 2022.\\n\\nPlot\\nRaj Malhotra and Simran Singh are both non-resident Indians (NRI) living in London. Simran is brought up in a strict and conservative household by her parents Baldev Singh and Lajwanti while Raj is raised by his liberal father Dharamvir Malhotra. Simran always dreams of meeting her ideal man; her mother Lajjo warns her against this, saying dreams are good, but one should not blindly believe they come true. One day, Baldev receives a letter from his friend Ajit, who lives in Punjab, India. Ajit wants to keep the promise he and Baldev made to each other 20 years ago — to have Simran marry his son Kuljeet. Simran is disappointed, as she does not want to marry someone whom she has never met.\\nOne evening, Raj enters Baldev\\'s shop after closing time to buy beer. Baldev refuses, but Raj grabs a case of beer, throws money on the counter, and runs away. An infuriated Baldev calls Raj a disgrace to India. Meanwhile, Dharamvir agrees to his request to go on a train trip across Europe with his friends, and Simran\\'s friends have invited her to go on the same trip. Simran asks Baldev to let her see the world before her marriage, and he reluctantly agrees.\\nOn the trip, Raj and Simran meet. Raj constantly flirts with Simran, much to her irritation. The two miss their train to Zürich and are separated from their friends, but start to travel together and become friends. Raj falls in love with Simran on the journey, and when they part ways in London, Simran realises she is in love with him as well. At home, Simran tells her mother about the boy she met on her trip; Baldev overhears the conversation and becomes enraged with his daughter. He says the family will move to India the next day. Meanwhile, Raj tells Dharamvir about Simran and that she will soon get married. When Raj says he believes Simran loves him too, Dharamvir encourages him to go after her. Raj goes to her house to woo her and Baldev, but is informed by their neighbour that they have sold their house and moved to India.\\nBack in India, Baldev is reunited with his relatives and his friend, Ajit. A miserable Simran and her younger sister Chutki take an instant dislike to Simran\\'s fiancé Kuljeet because of his arrogance. Simran pines for Raj, but her mother tells her to forget him because she knows Baldev will never accept their relationship. The next morning, Raj arrives outside of the house where Simran is staying and the two reunite. She begs him to elope with her, but Raj refuses and says he will only marry her with Baldev\\'s consent. Without disclosing his acquaintance with Simran, Raj befriends Kuljeet, and is quickly accepted by both families. Later, Dharamvir also arrives in India and becomes friends with Simran\\'s and Kuljeet\\'s families. Eventually, Lajjo and Chutki discover that Raj is the boy Simran fell in love with in Europe. Lajjo also tells Raj and Simran to run away, but he still refuses. Baldev recognises Raj from the beer incident but eventually accepts him. However, after he discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran together in Europe, he slaps and humiliates Raj and tells him to leave.\\nAs Raj and Dharamvir wait at the railway station, Kuljeet, who is angry to learn of Raj\\'s love for Simran, arrives with his friends and attack them. Raj refuses to fight back until his father is struck by Kuljeet when trying to save his son at which an enraged Raj gains the upper hand in his struggle against Kuljeet and his friends and brutally beats him. Baldev and Ajit soon arrive and stop the fight, and Raj boards the departing train with Dharamvir. Simran then arrives with Lajjo and Chutki; she tries to join Raj on the train, but Baldev stops her. Simran begs him to let her go, saying she cannot live without Raj. Baldev, realising nobody loves his daughter more than Raj does, lets her go, and she runs and catches the train as it departs.\\n\\nCast\\nCredits adapted from the British Film Institute.\\n\\nProduction\\nOrigin and scripting\\nAditya Chopra assisted his father, director and producer Yash Chopra, during the making of Chandni (1989), Lamhe (1991) and Darr (1993). During this time, Aditya wrote several of his own scripts, including one he assumed would be his first film, but eventually became his second, Mohabbatein (2000). For three years, he worked on the story that would become Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge before approaching his father to direct it. Yash did not want to and tried to persuade Aditya to do it himself. As they were discussing ideas for the script, Aditya conceived the notion that Raj would seek permission for marriage from Simran\\'s stern father, rather than eloping with her. He then became excited about the possibility of directing the film himself. After his mother, the playback singer Pamela Chopra, agreed that the idea was sound, he decided to make this his directorial debut. Aditya wanted to make a wholesome film that people could watch repeatedly. He wanted to diverge from the typical plot line of the time, in which lovers run away when their parents object, and show that if their love was strong enough, the parents would eventually understand.In May 1994, Aditya read the first draft of the script to several members of the Yash Raj Films production team assigned to work with him, including a cinematographer, an art director, and a dialogue writer. They were not impressed, but Aditya held fast to his ideas. He was given total editorial control by his father, the producer, and made the film according to his own tastes and sensibilities. Aditya struggled with both the dialogue writer Javed Siddiqui and the song lyricist Anand Bakshi to develop words that were \"young-sounding\". There were personal clashes over writing credits on the final script. Pamela\\'s friend Honey Irani believed she deserved a writing credit that she did not receive, and Siddiqui believed Aditya did not deserve partial credit for the dialogue. After Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, neither of them ever worked with Yash Raj Films again. After approving the script, Yash was consulted about the songs, but mostly left the creative process to his son, and has firmly denied that he was a ghost director on the project. He did not shoot a single frame, and did not even view some portions of the film until it was nearly completed.\\n\\nCasting\\nAditya originally wanted the film to be about a relationship between an Indian and an American. He wanted Tom Cruise for the role of Raj but was dissuaded by Yash, who did not want to use a foreign star. They decided their characters would be non-resident Indians (NRIs). Aditya approached Shah Rukh Khan to play the role of Raj. Shah Rukh was initially not interested because of the romantic nature of the role, having had success playing villainous roles. Aditya then asked Saif Ali Khan to play the lead role because he was having problems persuading Shah Rukh to do it. Saif declined for unknown reasons, as did Aamir Khan, causing Aditya to continue pursuing Shah Rukh. Aditya and Shah Rukh had four meetings over several weeks; he finally persuaded Shah Rukh by telling him he could never be a superstar unless he became \"every woman\\'s dream man, and every mother\\'s dream son\". Since then, Shah Rukh has expressed his gratitude to Aditya for helping to make him a star with this film. Shah Rukh said that fellow actor Salman Khan also encouraged him to do the role, saying that he thought the film would be very successful. Shah Rukh has also noted the similarities in the film\\'s script to his own relationship with Gauri Khan before their marriage.Kajol was the first choice to play Simran, to which she quickly agreed.  She and Shah Rukh had previously worked together in the successful films Baazigar (1993) and Karan Arjun (1995). Kajol said her character was very difficult for her to relate to, whereas Shah Rukh said Raj\\'s personality was very similar to his own. Aditya chose the name Raj for the character, and the mandolin that he played, based on his admiration for the actor Raj Kapoor. After a successful screen test, Parmeet Sethi was chosen over Armaan Kohli for the role of Kuljeet Singh. In addition to his assistant director Sameer Sharma, Aditya asked for two additional assistants, his brother Uday Chopra along with Karan Johar. Johar also played a small role in the film as Raj\\'s friend. Sharmishta Roy was the film\\'s art director and Manish Malhotra was its costume designer. While Malhotra had many new ideas, Aditya wanted to keep the clothing style simple; he did not want it to distract from the story. Despite this, Malhotra was responsible for the idea of Simran wearing a green dress in the song \"Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna\", an unusual colour for a Punjabi bride.\\n\\nFilming\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was filmed in several 5-, 10- and 20-day schedules between September 1994 and August 1995. The first sequence filmed was for the song \"Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko\" with Kajol and Shah Rukh in Switzerland. The European journey scenes and songs were mainly filmed in Saanen, Montbovon and Gstaad, Switzerland. Other scenes were shot in England, at locations including Trafalgar Square, King\\'s Cross railway station and Angel Underground station. Film\\'s cinematographer Manmohan Singh, a regular collaborator with Chopra, shot the song \"Tujhe Dekha To\", including the iconic mustard fields scenes with Shah Rukh and Kajol in the mustard fields in Gurgaon on the outskirts of the National Capital Region Delhi. The cast faced difficulties while filming the final scene, which shows Simran running to catch the train on which Raj is travelling. The smouldering heat made it difficult to shoot and each time there was a retake, the train took 20 minutes to return.Saroj Khan was the choreographer throughout most of the production, but after several disputes between her and Aditya, she was replaced by Farah Khan near the end of the shoot. After the film\\'s eventual success, Saroj apologised to Aditya for underestimating him, but she never worked with him again. Farah choreographed the song \"Ruk Ja O Dil Deewane\", during which Aditya did not tell Kajol that Shah Rukh was going to drop her, as he wanted to capture her genuine reaction. The film\\'s title was suggested by actress Kirron Kher; it came from the song \"Le Jayenge Le Jayenge\", in the film Chor Machaye Shor (1974). The Raj character sings parts of this song during the story, and it recurs at the end. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is believed to be the first Bollywood film with a \"Title suggested by\" credit. The film has since become universally known by the acronym DDLJ.Towards the end of the principal photography, Shah Rukh had to split his time between this film and Trimurti (1995), spending half of his day on each film. In early August 1995, when filming on Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was not yet finished, a release date in October around the time of the Diwali festival was decided upon. Composers Jatin and Lalit Pandit were given only 10 days to complete the background score, and the first copies were printed on 30 September. After filming was complete, Aditya decided to make a Hollywood-style documentary of the film-making process, which had not been done before in India. Karan Johar and Uday were put in charge because they had already been recording some of the processes. On 18 October, two days before the film\\'s release, the 30-minute special Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, The Making was broadcast on television by Doordarshan.\\n\\nThemes\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge repeats the usual conservative agenda of family, courtship and marriage, but it proposes that Indian family values are portable assets that can be upheld regardless of country of residence. To prove this, Raj, an NRI who was brought up in London, is portrayed as the story\\'s \"good guy\", whereas Kuljeet, raised in India, is portrayed as the villain. This is a reversal of the roles in typical Indian films, which usually portray Indians as being morally superior to Westerners. Here, NRIs are validated as potential model Indian citizens.The story aims to capture the struggle between traditional family values and the modern value of individualism. Although Raj and Simran want to be together regardless of her father\\'s plans for her, Raj tries to win over his girlfriend\\'s father rather than simply eloping with her. In this and other Indian stories, family values are ultimately considered more important than the romantic plot. Moral values and rules of conduct take precedence over individual desires. The film implies that \"Indianness\" can be defined by the importance of family life; whether at home or abroad, it is the Indian family system that is recognised as the social institution that most defines Indian identity.In Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, the purity/sanctity of women is being related to that of the nation. In the scene after Raj and Simran spend the night together, and Simran is concerned that something happened, Raj tells her: \"You think I am beyond values, but I am a Hindustani, and I know what a Hindustani girl\\'s izzat (honour) is worth. Trust me, nothing happened last night.\" This speaks to the Indian diaspora and their need to try and sustain their value system, and the man\\'s responsibility to protect the Indian woman\\'s sexual purity. In The Routledge Encyclopedia of Films, Ranjani Mazumdar says the film has a running theme of unfulfilled desires, which is exemplified by Raj\\'s father telling him to enjoy life because his own was a struggle, and Simran\\'s mother telling her to run away with Raj because she was unable to live her own dreams.Scott Jordan Harris, writing for Roger Ebert\\'s website, says the film\\'s popularity lies in its ability to effectively convey two opposing themes appealing to different portions of society. He said, \"It argues that we should follow our hearts and chase happiness wherever it leads, regardless of the obstacles in our paths, while simultaneously suggesting we should respect the ways of our elders, particularly our parents, and do nothing that challenges their will\". Rachel Dwyer said the film was important for presenting marriage as an understanding between parents and children. While fighting the old tradition of the arranged marriage, it still encouraged the importance of seeking parental consent, even for a love marriage. According to Patricia Uberoi, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge reiterates the theme of Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994) in a self-conscious manner while also linking it explicitly to the fact that the protagonists tend to remind themselves and each other of what it means to be an Indian.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge soundtrack features seven songs composed by Jatin–Lalit, a duo consisting of the brothers Jatin and Lalit Pandit. Anand Bakshi wrote the lyrics and Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kumar Sanu, Abhijeet Bhattacharya and Udit Narayan performed the vocals. Jatin–Lalit was considered for the job when singer Asha Bhosle contacted Yash Chopra after meeting the duo. It was their first collaboration with Yash Raj Films. They secured the job after singing \"Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna\" for Yash. In return, they ensured she sang one song, \"Zara Sa Jhoom Loon Main\". Pamela Chopra helped them select tunes and instruments to give some of the songs a Punjabi flavour. Bhasker Gupta, writing for AllMusic, said the soundtrack was the best of Jatin–Lalit\\'s career, and that it \"marked the beginning of the fifth wave in Indian cinema ...\".The soundtrack became the best-selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year, with 12 million official units sold by HMV, although it is estimated the same number or more copies were pirated. More than 1 million of those sales occurred prior to the film\\'s release, with Chopra earning an advance of ₹10 million for the music rights. Gulshan Kumar sold an unofficial version of the soundtrack under his T-Series label. Combined sales of both the official HMV version and the unofficial T-Series version amounted to 20 million copies. The total number of estimated sales including pirated copies range from 25 million to over 100 million.In 2005, the album was judged the top Hindi soundtrack of all time by voters on the BBC Asian Network website. Anand Bakshi won his third Filmfare Best Lyricist award after 14 years, having two nominations for this film. The wedding song \"Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna\" from the film became an all-time hit; it is played at weddings across the South Asian diaspora.\\n\\nRelease\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge opened on 20 October 1995 to sold-out shows worldwide. Every show in every theatre in Mumbai—save one—was completely full for the first week. The film was popular among both resident Indians and NRIs. At San Francisco\\'s 720-seat Naz theatre, 1,000 people arrived for the first showing, and the theatre staff were forced to run another show late that night. In the UK, the film ran for over a year. As of March 16, 2020 the Maratha Mandir cinema hall in Mumbai had been showing for 1251 weeks (24 years).\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nThe film opened with over ₹800 million (US$24.67 million) grossed in its first month of release. The film\\'s initial Hindi run earned ₹1.13 billion (valued at about US$35,000,000 in 1995) in India and about ₹200 million (valued at about US$6,200,000 in 1995) overseas; it became the highest-grossing Indian film of the year, and the second-highest-grossing film of the 1990s, behind Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! It was the second Indian film to gross over ₹1 billion worldwide, and one of the biggest Bollywood earners of all time. The film went on to gross a total of ₹2 billion ($60 million) worldwide as of 1996.Adjusted for inflation, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is among the highest-grossing Hindi films ever; its domestic net income (₹533 million at the time) is approximately ₹4.613 billion ($62 million) when adjusted for inflation in 2017. As of 2009, the film had generated over ₹60 million in revenues for the Maratha Mandir since its release. In later years, that theatre ran one matinee show per day at reduced ticket prices, which averaged about 50% occupancy.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge received many favourable reviews. An initial review by weekly magazine Screen said of Aditya Chopra, \"A young master arrives\". Tom Vick, reviewing the film for Allmovie, said, \"An immensely likeable movie, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge performs the rarely achieved feat of stretching a predictable plot over three hours and making every minute enjoyable.\" When the film toured the US in 2004 as part of the Cinema India showcase, \"The Changing Face of Indian Cinema\", Charles Taylor reviewed the film for Salon and said, \"It\\'s a flawed, contradictory movie—aggressive and tender, stiff and graceful, clichéd and fresh, sophisticated and naive, traditional and modern. It\\'s also, I think, a classic.\"Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra said, \"Perhaps the innocence of Raj and Simran\\'s romance in which they can spend the night together without sex because Raj, the bratish [sic] NRI understands the importance of an Indian woman\\'s honor. Perhaps it\\'s the way in which the film artfully reaffirms the patriarchal status quo and works for all constituencies—the NRI and the local viewer. Or perhaps it\\'s the magic of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol who created a template for modern love, which was hip and cool but resolutely Indian.\" She also called the film a milestone that shaped Hindi cinema through the 1990s, and one of her personal favourites. In 2004, Meor Shariman of The Malay Mail called the film a \"must watch\" for Bollywood fans, and also for those seeking an introduction to Bollywood.Raja Sen gave a reflective review for Rediff.com in 2005, calling the film one of the best Hindi films made in the previous 20 years. He said \"Shah Rukh Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the Lover for the 1990s with great panache\", and called Kajol a \"real-as-life actress bringing warmth and credulity\" to her role. Sen called the film well balanced and said only the fight scene and some mother-daughter dialogue can wear after multiple viewings. Omer M. Mozaffar, writing for RogerEbert.com in 2012, likened the film to a Disney Princess story, saying, \"the young princess feeling trapped by the traditional patriarchy, seeking freedom through discovering the world, but finally finding it through silent, but inappropriate love. The Little Mermaid. Beauty (of the Beast). Jasmine (friends with Aladdin). Pocahontas. Aurora (Sleeping Beauty). And here, Simran.\" Scott Jordan Harris, also writing for RogerEbert.com in 2014, called it \"one of the world\\'s favorite films\", and said it plays as a masterful soap opera, with one of the best screen couples ever seen.\\n\\nAccolades\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was ranked among The Times of India\\'s list of the \"10 Bollywood movies you must see before you die\". It was one of three Hindi films in the film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, the others being Mother India (1957) and Deewaar (1975). It was placed twelfth on the British Film Institute\\'s list of top Indian films of all time. It is one of the films on Box Office India\\'s list of \"Biggest Blockbusters Ever in Hindi Cinema\". The film won a National Film Award and 10 Filmfare Awards, setting the record at the time for the most Filmfare trophies.\\n\\nLegacy\\nHistoric box office run\\nIn 2001, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge overtook Sholay (1975), which had run for over five years at the Minerva theatre, as the longest-running film in Indian cinema history. It has been showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre (which was famous for having shown Mughal-e-Azam (1960) for three years) since its original release in 1995. There are often people in the audience who have seen the film 50 or more times, but still clap, cheer, mouth the dialogues and sing along with the songs, raising comparisons with The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), the longest running film in America.When a theatre strike in early 2011 threatened the film\\'s uninterrupted run, the producer Yash Chopra contacted theatre owners to try and ensure the film would continue. He hoped the film would continue to run for at least 1,000 weeks, which it achieved in December 2014. To commemorate the event, cast members including Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Anupam Kher, Farida Jalal, Mandira Bedi and Pooja Ruparel appeared on the television show Comedy Nights with Kapil.  Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and director Aditya Chopra also attended a live chat with fans and a black tie event at the theatre on 12 December. The same day, they launched a coffee table book written by Aditya Chopra about the making of the film. Also in December, Yash Raj Films announced the availability of a collection of commemorative, licensed merchandise from various suppliers to mark the event.The Maratha Mandir\\'s management ended the film\\'s run after 1,009 weeks on 19 February 2015 because of low attendance (the last show was viewed by 210 people). However, after an outpouring of support from fans, and talks with the production company, they decided to reinstate the film. As of March 16, 2020, it had been showing for 1251 weeks (24 years). The projectionist, who has been working at the Mandir for 46 years, has watched the film more than 9,000 times. The COVID-19 lockdown in India caused the theater to close for eight months; upon its re-opening in November 2020, screening of the film resumed.\\n\\nInfluence\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge spawned many imitators of its story and style, especially throughout the 1990s. According to the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema, it and a handful of other films and young directors started a trend for \"designer\" films. The authors said that these were \"a carefully packaged and branded product in which every little visual and physical detail ... is of utmost importance\". In Bollywood\\'s Top 20: Superstars of Indian Cinema, Namrata Joshi said Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge \"reinvented Bollywood romances so decisively that we can neatly divide them into two eras—before DDLJ and after DDLJ\".Yash Raj Films was previously known for using locations outside India for item numbers in its films. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge started the trend for films designed to appeal to the Indian diaspora, which have foreign locations as integral parts of the story. The characters are themselves diaspora and tend to be able to move with ease between India and the West. Some later films that followed this trend include Pardes (1997), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Salaam Namaste (2005), Neal \\'n\\' Nikki (2005) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge became the first Hindi film blockbuster to feature NRIs as main characters. It helped to establish the diaspora market as a vital source of revenue for the industry; that market was seen as a safer financial investment than the desi market.Several later films have paid homage to Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. The Karan Johar-produced Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania (2014) was directly inspired by it. The films Jab We Met (2007), Bodyguard (2011), Chalo Dilli (2011), Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013) and Chennai Express (2013) include scenes similar to the climactic train sequence, wherein a woman is running to catch a moving train and is helped aboard by a man with his outstretched arm. The British film Slumdog Millionaire (2008) contained a similar train scene, and its final dance sequence was partially shot at the same railway station as the Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge finale.In October 2021, Aditya announced that he would be directing a Broadway musical entitled Come Fall In Love – The DDLJ Musical, based on the film. It will debut in the Broadway season of 2022–2023.\\n\\nImpact\\nAudiences appreciated the screen chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who later worked together in several successful films including Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), My Name Is Khan (2010), and Dilwale (2015), and are often referred to as one of Indian cinema\\'s most loved on-screen couple. Sogosurvey conducted an online survey in 2016 in which approximately 47% of the people who participated voted Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge as Bollywood\\'s most evergreen love story. Shah Rukh Khan credits this film with making him a star, and says it \"changed the entire scene for romantic movies of the 90s\". During an interview in 2002, he said \"Whatever I\\'ll stand for as an actor, in the whole of my career, whenever it ends, it will start with and end at Dilwale\". The actress Farida Jalal said the film gave her career a boost, saying she got many offers and \"could quote any price\". It also helped the young careers of Pooja Ruparel, who received advertising offers, and of Sharmistha Roy.The British Film Institute (BFI) commissioned a book about Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. It was the first Hindi film chosen for a series of studies on international films, called \"BFI Modern Classics\". The author was Anupama Chopra and the book was released in 2002. It was reissued in paperback by Harper-Collins as Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: The Making of a Blockbuster in 2004. After an unexpectedly long delay, the film was released on DVD by Yash Raj Films in 2002. The release included The Making and 300 Weeks Celebration documentaries, Success Story (highlights from the film\\'s premiere), clips from the 41st Filmfare Awards ceremony and other interviews.In 2006, members of the film crew were honoured at a dinner event to celebrate the film\\'s 500th week since release. It was hosted by the Consulate General of Switzerland in Mumbai and by Switzerland Tourism. In 2010, Yash Raj Films signed an agreement with Indian and Swiss tour companies to provide a tour package called \"YRF Enchanted Journey\", to allow visitors to Switzerland to view filming locations used for famous Yash Raj films including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. In 2014, Yash Raj Films released Aditya Chopra Relives ... Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (As Told to Nasreen Munni Kabir), an attractive but expensive book about the making of the film. In response to Indian prime minister Narendra Modi quoting the line \"May the force be with you\" from the American film franchise Star Wars during a visit to the United States, US President Barack Obama decided to quote a line from a Hindi film during his visit to India in January 2015. He chose a line from this film, \"Senorita, bade bade deshon mein ...\" (Miss, in large countries ...), and added \"you know what I mean\". US President Donald Trump mentioned DDLJ as a \"Classic Indian Films\" during his visit to India in February 2020.\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nBibliography\\nFurther reading\\nExternal links\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge Official Site\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge at IMDb\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge at the British Film Institute\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge at the TCM Movie Database\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge at AllMovie\\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge at Bollywood Hungama',\n",

The pair visit a rundown slum known as Pigsty Alley to extort the residents by pretending to be Axe members. Sing\\'s actions eventually attract the real gang, who confront the villagers. Gang reinforcements arrive but they are all quickly dealt with by three of the slum\\'s tenants: Coolie, Tailor, and Donut, who reveal they are actually kung fu masters. However, fearing the Axe Gang\\'s retaliation, the slum\\'s Landlady evicts the trio.\\nBrother Sum captures Sing and Bone, intending to kill them for posing as gang members. However, Sing and Bone narrowly escape. Impressed, Brother Sum allows them to join the gang on the condition that they kill someone. Sing recalls his childhood to Bone when he was tricked by a vagrant into buying a martial arts pamphlet with his meager savings. After practicing the pamphlet\\'s Buddhist Palm technique, Sing attempted to save a mute girl named Fong from bullies but was instead beaten and humiliated. Sing became adamant that heroes never win and resolved to be a villain.\\nSing and Bone return to Pigsty Alley to kill the Landlady but fail and are chased off the premises. Sing, injured in the process, retreats to a traffic pulpit where his body mysteriously heals in no time. Meanwhile, Brother Sum, intent on gaining revenge on the Pigsty Alley residents, hires two Harpists that use a magical guzheng as their weapon. They successfully eliminate the three masters but are defeated by both the Landlady and her husband Landlord, who reveal themselves to be skilled fighters as well. \\nA frustrated Sing attempts to rob an ice cream vendor but discovers that she is actually Fong. When she recognizes him and offers him a lollipop, he smashes it and leaves in shame.

Sing brings the Beast back to the Axe Gang\\'s headquarters.\\nBrother Sum is initially skeptical of the Beast due to his flippant attitude and sloppy appearance, but quickly changes his mind when the Beast stops a bullet midair. The Beast meets the Landlady and Landlord at the casino next door, engaging in a fierce fight with them that ends in a stalemate. Sing, realizing the error of his ways, attacks the Beast, who angrily retaliates. The Landlady and Landlord grab the unconscious Sing and flee. The Beast eliminates Brother Sum and takes over as leader of the Axes.\\nThe Landlady and Landlord treat Sing at Pigsty Alley and are surprised by his quick recovery.

He is killed by the Axe Gang at the start of the film. He was the last gang leader to be killed by Brother Sum.\\n\\nBackground\\nThe climate of the film industry and the expectation of a 21st-century action film were different throughout the history of Chinese cinema. However, this difference provides one of the reasons why Kung Fu Hustle was so well received.\\n\\nKung Fu Hustle responded to and amplified a global demand for the reawakening of martial arts cinema—and one which was fulfilled by a multitude of reiterations of the genre, all of which can be said, without a doubt, fulfilled the criteria for 21st-century action cinema: high budget, stylish, and action-packed.\\nDirectors and their contemporaries changed the martial arts cinema together to gain more universal appeal. The work has built martial arts as a viable mode of behavioural expression in the movie, and also displayed how martial arts could be transformed in the cinema industry to reflect both \"contemporary local issues and the increasingly important reality of globalization.\" Unlike Ang Lee\\'s wuxia film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Stephen Chow chose to use the perspective of a lowly gangster to break into Wuxia and Jianghu. Kung Fu does not succeed because it is so localised. Quite the contrary, Kung Fu Hustle embodies a complex transnationalism.While martial arts began a new wave in Chinese cinema, Stephen Chow and other directors were responsible for the creation of another subset of martial arts cinema, which included the vampire genre. Stephen Chow combined elements such as undead, Taoism, kung fu, as well as comedy into his movies, which helped create a comedy-horror feel that was distinct to Hong Kong. The beginning of martial arts movies has paved the future for both local and international directors. They started to learn and adopt martial arts to fulfill and satisfy their own demands, later the trend became a transnational market.Different from traditional Chinese wuxia cinema, Chow\\'s new kung fu movies help with reflecting the extent to force the of globalisation within the entertainment industry, which later influenced the local construction of self-identity.\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nKung Fu Hustle is a co-production of the Beijing Film Studio and Hong Kong\\'s Star Overseas. After the success of his 2001 film, Shaolin Soccer, Chow was approached in 2002 by Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia, offering to collaborate with him on a project. Chow accepted the offer, and the project eventually became Kung Fu Hustle. Kung Fu Hustle was produced with a budget of US$20 million.Chow was inspired to create the film by the martial arts films he watched as a child and by his childhood ambition to become a martial artist. A senior Hollywood executive said Chow was \"forced to grind through four successive scripts\" and \"found it very laborious\".Chow\\'s first priority was to design the main location of the film, \"Pigsty Alley\". Later in an interview Chow remarked that he had created the location from his childhood, basing the design on the crowded apartment complexes of Hong Kong where he had lived. The 1973 Shaw Brothers Studio film, The House of 72 Tenants, was another inspiration for Pigsty Alley. Designing the Alley began in January 2003 and took four months to complete. Many of the props and furniture in the apartments were antiques from all over China.\\n\\nCasting\\nKung Fu Hustle features several prolific Hong Kong action cinema actors from the 1970s. Yuen Wah, a former student of the China Drama Academy Peking Opera School who appeared in over a hundred Hong Kong films and was a stunt double for Bruce Lee, played the Landlord of Pigsty Alley. Wah considered starring in Kung Fu Hustle to be the peak of his career. In spite of the film\\'s success, he worried that nowadays fewer people practice martial arts.Auditions for the role of the Landlady began in March 2003. Yuen Qiu, who did not audition, was spotted during her friend\\'s screen test smoking a cigarette with a sarcastic expression on her face, which won her the part. Qiu, a student of Yu Jim-yuen, sifu of the China Drama Academy, had appeared in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun at the age of 18. After a number of other small roles, she retired from films in the 1980s. Kung Fu Hustle was her first role in nineteen years. Qiu, in order to fulfill Chow\\'s vision for the role, gained weight for the role by eating midnight snacks every day.Bruce Leung, who played the Beast, was Stephen Chow\\'s childhood martial arts hero. Leung Siu Lung was a famous action film director and actor in the 1970s and 1980s, known as the \"Third Dragon\" after Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. After becoming unpopular in the Taiwanese film market in the late 1980s following a visit to China, he switched to a career in business. Kung Fu Hustle was his return to the film industry after a fifteen-year hiatus. He regarded Chow as a flexible director with high standards, and was particularly impressed by the first scene involving the Beast, which had to be reshot 28 times.In addition to famous martial artists, Kung Fu Hustle features legends of Chinese cinema. Two famous Chinese directors appear in the film: Zhang Yibai, who plays Inspector Chan at the beginning of the film, and Feng Xiaogang, who plays the boss of the Crocodile Gang.In casting Sing\\'s love interest Fong, Chow stated that he wanted an innocent looking girl for the role. Television actress Eva Huang, in her film debut, was chosen from over 8,000 women. When asked about his decision in casting her, Chow said that he \"just had a feeling about her\" and that he enjoyed working with new actors. She chose to have no dialogue in the film so that she could stand out only with her body gestures.\\n\\nFilming\\nFilming took place in Shanghai from June 2003 to November 2003. Two-thirds of the time was spent shooting the fight sequences. Those scenes were initially choreographed by Sammo Hung, who quit after two months due to illness, tough outdoor conditions, interest in another project and arguments with the production crew. Hung was replaced by Yuen Woo-ping, an action choreographer with experience ranging from 1960s Hong Kong action cinema to more recent films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix. Yuen promptly accepted the offer. Yuen drew on seemingly outdated wuxia fighting styles like the Deadly Melody and Buddhist Palm. He remarked that despite the comedic nature of the film, the shooting process was a serious matter due to the tight schedule.Most of the special effects in the film, created by Hong Kong computer graphics company Centro Digital Pictures Limited, which had previously worked on films such as Shaolin Soccer and Kill Bill, included a combination of computer-generated imagery and wire work. Centro Digital performed extensive tests on CGI scenes before filming started, and treatment of the preliminary shots began immediately afterwards. The CGI crew edited out wire effects and applied special effects in high resolution. Legendary martial arts mentioned in wuxia novels were depicted and exaggerated through CGI, but actual people were used for the final fight between Chow\\'s character and hundreds of axe-wielding gangsters. After a final calibration of colour, data of the processed scenes was sent to the US for the production of the final version. A group of six people followed the production crew throughout the shooting.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe majority of the film\\'s original score was composed by Raymond Wong and performed by the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra. The score imitates traditional Chinese music used in 1940s swordplay films. One of Wong\\'s works, Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained, provides a stark contrast between the villainous Axe Gang and the peaceful neighbourhood of Pigsty Alley, depicted by a Chinese folk song, Fisherman\\'s Song of the East China Sea. Along with Wong\\'s compositions and various traditional Chinese songs, classical compositions are featured in the score, including excerpts from Zigeunerweisen by Pablo de Sarasate and Sabre Dance by Aram Khachaturian. The song, Zhiyao Weini Huo Yitian (只要為你活一天; Only Want to Live One Day for You), is sung in the background by Eva Huang at the end of the film. Written by Liu Chia-chang in the 1970s, it tells of a girl\\'s memories of a loved one, and her desire to live for him again. Kung Fu Hustle was nominated for Best Original Film Score at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards.Asian and American versions of the soundtrack were released. The Asian version of the soundtrack was released on 17 December 2004 by Sony Music Entertainment and has 33 tracks. The American version of the soundtrack was released on 29 March 2005 by Varèse Sarabande and has 19 tracks, with 14 tracks missing compared to the Asian release.The soundtrack for the trailer was mastered at Epiphany Music and Recording, Inc. in Santa Rosa, California.\\n\\nReferences to other works\\nKung Fu Hustle makes references to a wide range of films, animated cartoons, wuxia novels, anime and other sources. The housing arrangement of the Pigsty Alley is similar to that of a 1973 Hong Kong film, The House of 72 Tenants. It is set in a Shanghai Shantytown taking Hong Kong viewers back to their days of hardship but also making the audience in mainland China interested in, as Ho pointed out, \"Chow appropriates Hong Kong\\'s past to address China\\'s current anxieties over rapid modernization and secures the former colony\\'s bond with its semi-reunited motherland-in both emotional and film business terms\". There are two references to Chow\\'s previous film, Shaolin Soccer: When Sing arrives at Pigsty Alley, he plays skilfully with a soccer ball, then says, \"You\\'re still playing football?\". The second reference is the scene in which a clerk beats Sing up on a bus. The clerk also appeared in Shaolin Soccer as the leader of an opposing team who used hidden weapons to beat up the Shaolin soccer team. When Sing challenges a boy in the Pigsty Alley, Sing calls him \"The Karate Kid\", a reference to the 1984 film of the same name. During the altercation between Sing and the hairdresser, the hairdresser states, \"Even if you kill me, there will be thousands more of me!\". This is a reference to a famous quote made by Lu Haodong, a Chinese revolutionary in the late Qing dynasty. The scene in which Sing is chased by the Landlady as he flees from the Alley is a homage to Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, characters in the Looney Tunes cartoons, even including the pursuer\\'s (the Landlady\\'s) ill fate. During the opening scene in which the leader of the Crocodile Gang is killed by Brother Sum of the Axe Gang, in the background a poster for the 1939 film Le Jour Se Lève is visible. In the scene in which Sing robs the ice cream vendor, a poster for the 1935 film Top Hat is in the background. As Sing arrives at the door to the Beast\\'s cell in the mental asylum, he hallucinates a large wave of blood rushing from the cell door, similar to a scene in The Shining. The Landlady says at one point, \"Tomorrow is another day\", which is a line from the 1936 novel Gone with the Wind and its 1939 film adaptation.\\nA major element of the plot is based on the wuxia film series Palm of Ru Lai (如來神掌), released in 1964. Sing studied the fighting style used in Palm of Ru Lai (\"Buddhist Palm style\"), from a young age and used it at the end of Kung Fu Hustle. In reality, the Buddhist Palm fighting style does not leave palm-shaped craters and holes on impact. Instead, the user delivers powerful punches using his palm. The Beast\\'s name in Chinese, Huoyun Xieshen (火雲邪神; Evil Deity of the Fiery Cloud), and the fight with the Landlady and her husband are also references to the Palm of Ru Lai, in which a mortally wounded master strikes the patterns of his art\\'s final techniques into a bell so that his apprentice can learn from it. Kung Fu Hustle also contains direct references to characters from Louis Cha\\'s wuxia novels. For example, the landlord and landlady refer to themselves as Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, the names of characters in Cha\\'s The Return of the Condor Heroes, when they met the Beast.\\n\\nReferences to gangster films are also present. Many fight scenes and superhuman power displayed by Kung Fu Masters in the film are reminiscent of Dragon Ball Z and similar anime. The boss of the Axe Gang, Brother Sum (琛哥) is named after Hon Sam / Hon Sum (韓琛), the triad boss played by Eric Tsang in Infernal Affairs. The Harpists imitate The Blues Brothers, wearing similar hats and sunglasses at all times. When they are flattered by the Axe Gang advisor, one of them answers, \"Strictly speaking we\\'re just musicians\", similar to a line by Elwood Blues.When Donut dies, he says, \"In great power lies great responsibility\", a reference to 2002\\'s Spider-Man, said by Uncle Ben before his death. Additionally, in that scene, the Landlady says, \"Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons\", a reference to Jean Renoir\\'s 1939 film The Rules of the Game. Afterwards, with his dying breath, Donut gets up, grabs the Landlord by the shirt and utters in English, \"What are you prepared to do?\", a nod to Sean Connery\\'s character Jim Malone in Brian De Palma\\'s 1987 film The Untouchables.The dialogue that the Beast says while negotiating with the Axe Gang for killing the Landlady and Landlord—\"... then young friend, I will make an offer you cannot refuse\", is a reference of the dialogue from the movie The Godfather. Also, the Landlady\\'s comment to Brother Sum—\"We brought a gift you cannot refuse\" is an obvious parody of the same, to which Sum replies (in the dubbed version of the film), \"Ha! With the Beast on our side, we shall see for whom the bell tolls\", a reference to the 1943 film.The final fight between Sing (who has been reborn into \"the one\", which pays homage to Bruce Lee by wearing his costume in Enter the Dragon and using his fighting style) and the hundreds of gangsters imitates the fight between Neo and hundreds of Agent Smiths in The Matrix Reloaded. The scene in which the Beast prompts an Axe member to punch him harder is reminiscent of a similar scene in Raging Bull, with Robert De Niro\\'s character prompting Joe Pesci\\'s character.The last scene, in which the beggar tries to sell martial arts manuals, refers directly to the greatest skills in Louis Cha\\'s Condor Trilogy (Nine Yang Manual, \"Yiyang Finger\", and \"Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms\"), \"Thousand Hand Divine Fist\", and The Smiling, Proud Wanderer (\"Nine Swords of Dugu\"). The scene in which the landlady confronts Brother Sum in the back of his car is a homage to Bruce Lee in Way of the Dragon, where she cracks her knuckles and gives a quick upper nod to the mafia boss, telling him to back off.\\n\\nReleases\\nKung Fu Hustle premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. It was later released across East Asia including China, Hong Kong and Malaysia in December 2004. The film was first shown in the US at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2005, and then opened in a general release on 22 April 2005 after being shown in Los Angeles and New York for two weeks.The North American DVD release was on 8 August 2005. A Blu-ray version of the DVD was released on 12 December 2006 by Sony Pictures. A UMD version of the film was released for the PlayStation Portable. The United States DVD releases were censored, cutting a number of scenes that featured lots of blood or human excrement. A later release, called \"The Kick-Axe Edition\", restored these scenes.In the United Kingdom the standard DVD was released 24 October 2005, the same day a special edition was released with collector\\'s items, which included playing cards, a keyring, a sweat band, and an inflatable axe. On 8 April 2007, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released a Blu-ray version.The Portuguese title of the film is Kungfusão, which sounds like Kung Fu and Confusão (confusion). In the same way as Kungfusão, the Italian and Spanish titles were Kung-fusion and Kung-fusión, puns of \"confusion\". In France, the film is known as Crazy Kung Fu, and the Hungarian title is A Pofonok Földje, meaning The Land of Punches.In Korea a Limited Collector\\'s Edition DVD was released which included a leather wallet, Stephen Chow\\'s Palm Figure with his signature, a photo album and Special Kung Fu\\'s Booklet with a certificate of authenticity.\\n\\nReception\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 90% approval rating based on 182 reviews and an average rating of 7.7/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads: \"Kung Fu Hustle blends special effects, martial arts, and the Looney Toons to hilarious effect.\" On Metacritic, the film received a score of 78 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"Hong Kong director and film critic Gabriel Wong praised the film for its black comedy, special effects and nostalgia, citing the return of many retired kung fu actors from the 1970s. Film critic Roger Ebert\\'s description of the film (\"like Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Quentin Tarantino and Bugs Bunny\") was printed on the promotion posters for the film in the US. Other critics described it as a comedic version of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Positive reviews generally gave credit to the elements of mo lei tau comedy present in the film. A number of reviewers viewed it as a computer-enhanced Looney Tunes punch-up. In a 2010 interview, actor Bill Murray called Kung Fu Hustle \"the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy\". In 2021, American filmmaker James Gunn called it \"the greatest film ever made\".The combination of the necessary cynicism and sentential nostalgia which makes the audience laugh implies that a world of human complexity is beneath the interesting deceptive surface.Much of the criticism for the film was directed at its lack of character development and a coherent plot. Las Vegas Weekly, for instance, criticised the film for not having enough of a central protagonist and character depth. Criticism was also directed towards the film\\'s cartoonish and childish humour. However, it was considered reasonable, as the Kung Fu Hustle production team chose to make the film\\'s characters largely one-dimensional. In the movie, the directors \"attempt(ed) to appeal to a transnational audience, affirms distinctly Western notions of Chinese that many earlier Kung Fu films set out to subvert.\" The Kung Fu Hustle team attempt to appeal to a more progressive generation throughout the history of Chinese cinema. Earlier in the kung fu film industry, it usually involved complex characters, and also tried to explore and expose constructs ranging from gender to race as well as to nation. One-dimension is the key feature of Kung Fu Hustle, as it is rooted in a filmic genre that connected with Hong Kong identity, but also represented the Western imagination of China\\'s past and Kung Fu heroism.\\n\\nBox office\\nKung Fu Hustle opened in Hong Kong on 23 December 2004, and earned HK$4,990,000 on its opening day. It stayed at the top of the box office for the rest of 2004 and for much of early 2005, eventually grossing HK$61.27 million. Its box office tally made it the highest-grossing film in Hong Kong history, until it was beaten by You Are the Apple of My Eye in 2011. The phenomenal box office this work generated as well as the collective pleasure its local audience experienced potentially saved the Hong Kong film industry during a politically unstable time in the territory.Sony Pictures Classics opened Kung Fu Hustle in limited theatrical release in New York City and Los Angeles on 8 April 2005 before being widely released across North America on 22 April. In its first week of limited release in seven cinemas, it grossed US$269,225 (US$38,461 per screen). When it was expanded to a wide release in 2,503 cinemas, the largest number of cinemas ever for a foreign language film, it made a modest US$6,749,572 (US$2,696 per screen), eventually grossing a total of US$17,108,591 in 129 days. In total, Kung Fu Hustle had a worldwide gross of US$101,104,669. While not a blockbuster, Kung Fu Hustle managed to become the highest-grossing foreign-language film in North America in 2005 and went on to generate more than US$30,000,000 in the United States home video market.\\n\\nAccolades\\nThe film was nominated for sixteen Hong Kong Film Awards, out of which winning Best Picture, Best Action Choreography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Effects, Best Supporting Actor and Best Visual Effects. Five more awards were later picked up at the Golden Horse Awards including an award for Best Director for Stephen Chow. In the United States Kung Fu Hustle was well received by various film critic associations winning awards for Best Foreign Language Film from Boston-, Chicago-, Las Vegas- and Phoenix-based critics. it was later nominated for six Satellite Awards and one MTV Movie Award for best fight scene. In the United Kingdom at 59th British Academy Film Awards the film was nominated for a BAFTA.In 2011, the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival listed Kung Fu Hustle at number 48 in their list of \"100 Greatest Chinese-Language Films\". The majority of the voters originated from Taiwan, and included film scholars, festival programmers, film directors, actors and producers. In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. Kung Fu Hustle was listed at 50th place on this list.\\n\\nSequel\\nIn 2005, Chow announced that there would be a sequel to Kung Fu Hustle, although he had not settled on a female lead. \"There will be a lot of new characters in the movie. We\\'ll need a lot of new actors. It\\'s possible that we\\'ll look for people abroad besides casting locals\". In January 2013, during an interview, Chow admitted that plans for making Kung Fu Hustle 2 have been put on hold. \"I was indeed in the midst of making the movie, but it is currently put on hold in view of other incoming projects\". Production of Kung Fu Hustle 2 was delayed while Chow filmed the science fiction adventure film CJ7. As a result, Kung Fu Hustle 2 was slated for a 2014 release. By 2017, Chow had already completed The Mermaid and Journey to the West: The Demons Strike Back. Due to his focus on behind-the-scenes production and the fact that he has not made an appearance since CJ7, it was suspected that he had stopped acting. However, Chow clarified that he still wants to act, but has not found a role suited for him. Kung Fu Hustle 2 remains incomplete. In February 2019, during a promo interview for The New King of Comedy, Stephen confirmed that the sequel is in the works. He will direct the movie and possibly cameo in the film, but the story will not be a direct sequel to the first one. Chow explains the sequel will be a spiritual successor to the first one, but set in modern times.\\n\\nGames\\nOnline and mobile games\\nIn 2004 a promotional flash game was released by Sony Pictures Entertainment on their Japanese website. The game was created by Japanese game developer Point Zero and plays as a point-and-click beat \\'em up. A side-scrolling game designed for mobile phones was later released in 2006 by developer Tracebit.\\n\\nMMO\\nIn 2007 Sony Online Entertainment announced that a massively multiplayer online 2D side-scrolling fighter game based on the film was under development for the Chinese market. Two years later a preview of the game was featured at E3 where it received mixed reviews from critics with many comparing it to similar MMO games such as Guild Wars and Phantasy Star Online.A North American release for PC and PS3 was planned for late 2009, but never came to fruition. The game was only available in Asia for the PC.\\n\\nSee also\\nCinema of Hong Kong\\nCinema of China\\nKung Fu Panda (film) — A 2008 Hollywood film inspired by Kung Fu Hustle.\\nChandni Chowk to China — A 2009 Bollywood film inspired by Kung Fu Hustle.\\nEverything Everywhere All at Once — A 2022 Hollywood film inspired by Kung Fu Hustle.\\nList of films featuring the deaf and hard of hearing\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nOfficial website\\nKung Fu Hustle at IMDb\\nKung Fu Hustle at LoveHKFilm.com\\nKung Fu Hustle at AllMovie\\nThe Six Degrees of Stephen Chow and Kung Fu Hustle',\n",
       " 'Dil Chahta Hai (transl.\\u2009The Heart Desires) is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language comedy drama film written and directed by Farhan Akhtar. It was produced by Ritesh Sidhwani and released under the banner of Excel Entertainment (which Akhtar and Sidhwani co-founded), marking their cinematic debut. The film focuses on a significant transition period in the romantic lives of 3 college-graduate friends (Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna). It also stars Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni and Dimple Kapadia.\\nDil Chahta Hai was based on Akhtar\\'s diary detailing his trips to Mumbai and New York City, and a story by a friend of his, Kassim Jagmagia, who would ultimately become a creative associate at Excel Entertainment. He started writing the screenplay in 1998 but finished it when the film\\'s principal photography was started two years later. The film was produced on a budget of ₹80 million (US$1.0 million), and filming took place in both India and Australia. It was one of the first films shot in sync sound, with Nakul Kamte and H. Sridhar handling its sound recording. The trio Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, with lyrics penned by Akhtar\\'s father, Javed Akhtar, composed the soundtrack and the background score.\\nDil Chahta Hai premiered on 10 August 2001. The film performed moderately at the box office, grossing ₹397.2 million (US$5.0 million) after its theatrical run ended. It proved to be a major commercial success in metropolitan areas, but failed in rural areas; its failure in rural areas was attributed to the upper-class, city-oriented lifestyle it presented. It received widespread critical acclaim upon release, with praise for its fresh storyline, direction, soundtrack, cinematography, costumes and the performances of the cast. Several critics noted that it broke new ground by introducing a realistic portrayal of the modern Indian youth. \\nA recipient of several accolades, Dil Chahta Hai won 2 awards at the 49th National Film Awards, including Best Feature Film in Hindi. At the 47th Filmfare Awards, the film received 13 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director (Farhan), Best Actor (Aamir) and Best Music Director (Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy), and won 7 awards, including Best Film (Critics) and Best Supporting Actor (Khanna) and Best Comedian (Saif).\\n\\nPlot\\nAkash, Sameer and Sid are best friends in college. They spend all their time together, taking trips, playing pranks on each other and supporting the other when needed. Upon graduating from college, they are forced to decide what to do with their lives ahead. Sameer\\'s parents want to arrange his marriage with their friends\\' daughter, while Akash\\'s parents ask him to manage the family business abroad. Sid is busy trying to become a painter and works to develop his skill. \\nOne day, Sid runs into his new neighbour, Tara. She takes an interest in his art and the two become friends. Despite her older age, Sid finds himself attracted to her. After a night out, Sid confesses to Sameer and Akash that he loves Tara. In typical fashion, the friends refuse to take him seriously. Sameer realizes that Sid is not joking but Akash continues to mock him, leading Sid to slap him. Infuriated, Akash leaves the scene, refusing to reconcile with Sid despite Sameer\\'s attempts to mediate. Soon, Akash leaves for Sydney to work on the family business. \\nSid temporarily moves away to attend a painting workshop, leaving Sameer to his own means. He decides to pursue Pooja, the girl his parents wanted him to marry, and to whom he was attracted at first-sight. Pooja has a boyfriend but it seems their relationship is not going strong. When they inevitably break up, Sameer asks her out and Pooja agrees. \\nIn Sydney, Akash meets Shalini who shows him around the new city. The two soon fall in love, but she has to return to India to marry her fiancé, Rohit. Rohit is hot-tempered and had once punched Akash over a prank at their college\\'s graduation party. Now, however, Akash is determined not to lose Shalini and shows up at her wedding. He proposes to her in front of all the guests, Rohit and his family. Rohit is enraged but decides to yield on being told by Shalini that she loves Akash too. \\nSome time later, Sid returns home and calls Sameer up from a hospital. Sameer visits Sid, and at the waiting lounge of the hospital, catches Sid up on their life\\'s events. They discuss the night Sid and Akash fell apart, and Sameer lies to Sid about being unable to contact Akash. The next morning, however, Akash arrives at the hospital to bury the hatchet with Sid. He apologizes to him, and the two hug. \\nMeanwhile, Tara is about to die from liver cirrhosis. The hospital staff approach Sid to inform him, and he speaks with Tara for the last time in her hospital room. She thanks him for being there for her in her final moments and passes away, leaving Sid\\'s love for her unrequited. Six months later, the friends visit Goa for a trip, accompanied by Shalini and Pooja. Sid sees a woman who resembles Tara, and approaches to talk to her. It is implied that she and Sid get together, as the three friends are shown enjoying dinner with their respective partners.\\n\\nCast\\nCredits adapted from Bollywood Hungama:\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nDil Chahta Hai was based on Farhan Akhtar\\'s diary he wrote during his trips to Goa and his month-and-a-half-long stay in New York City in 1996, and a story by a friend of his, Kassim Jagmagia. He originally conceived a story about the romance between Akash and Shalini. He later shared it with his parents (Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani), who immediately liked his idea but suggested several changes. However, he felt the story was not exciting and unusual enough for him and started to develop other characters, including Akash\\'s friends, making his initial idea become the film\\'s subplot. He was quoted as saying that:\\n\\n\"I always wondered what happens to the best friends of the hero after reel number three. Where do they go? When he needs them the most, they are never there. And so at some time the weight of the story shifted from Aamir [Khan]\\'s love story with Preity [Zinta] to becoming a story about the friendships and how individual love stories affect the friendships.\"\\nWhile co-directing music videos for Shankar Mahadevan\\'s album Breathless (1998) with his sister Zoya Akhtar, Farhan began writing the film\\'s screenplay under the working title of Hum Teen in 1998. After principal photography commenced in 2000, the film was retitled Dil Chahta Hai. Talking to the magazine Screen, he told them that the screenplay reflected himself, his friendships, and his concerns, adding that it was \"definitely a fresh view of friendship in Hindi films\". Farhan originally wrote the dialogue in English, and he translated it to Hindi in two months. This marked the cinematic debut of Akhtar and his friend Ritesh Sidhwani, who produced it under their banner of Excel Entertainment. Several elements of the film were inspired by the English playwright William Shakespeare\\'s Much Ado About Nothing.\\n\\nCasting\\nAamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan (no relation), Akshaye Khanna, Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni, and Dimple Kapadia were chosen as the lead actors.Aamir, playing Akash Malhotra, described his character as a typical man of present-day India. He accepted to star in the film after reading the film\\'s screenplay, which he noted for its freshness. He said, \"He is, to a great extent, self-centered, doesn\\'t believe in love and doesn\\'t indulge in emotions. In that sense, he is quite shallow, but not really a bad guy at heart.\" He was also offered to portray Siddharth \"Sid\", but he did not want to change his mind because he believed he had played several roles of the same type. He admitted he liked the role of Akash, calling it was \"something [he] never done before\". In preparation, Aamir, 35, changed his style to a 24-year-old man in two months.Saif was cast as Sameer Mulchandani, a part he found to resemble his personality. Particularly drawn to the qualities of his role, he described the film as a \"learning experience\". Initially, he did not want to star in the film, but Kapadia and Javed Akhtar persuaded him to do so, which meant that he replaced Abhishek Bachchan.Farhan initially wanted Hrithik Roshan to play the role of Siddharth \"Sid\" Sinha after seeing his performance in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000). When Roshan declined due to date issues, Khanna stepped in to replace him. The press labelled this project as Khanna\\'s comeback film post a self-imposed two-year hiatus, after having featured in several commercially unsuccessful films. Khanna mentioned Dil Chahta Hai has a unique concept, and his interest in its script made him sign on to the film. His role gave him \"a very new sound, a very new look and a very young feel\" as well as a new screen image. Aamir spoke positively of his rapport with them, confessing that it was his dream to collaborate with the two.Zinta agreed to star in the film after reading its screenplay, which she referred to as \"fabulous\". Prior to filming, Zinta and Farhan had been long-time friends and had made a pact to do a film together. She performed a screen test at his house and was cast for the role of Shalini, Aamir\\'s love interest, and spent three-and-a-half months in preparation for the role.While Kulkarni got the part as Sameer\\'s love interest, and later fiancée Pooja, Kapadia was chosen for the middle-aged alcoholic interior designer and divorcée Tara and, according to Rediff.com, it was the first time she played the love interest of a much younger man. Kapadia told Filmfare that making the film was an enriching experience and called her part \"a role to die for\". In the interview, she also mentioned that the role was \"very dark\" as the character dies at the end of the film, which she did not like, and she felt that it has no \"sunshine except this little bond that she forms with\" Khanna\\'s character, Sid. Considering her as the film\\'s \"surprise package\", Farhan did not want to feature her in any of the promotional trailers and music videos aired on televisions because he wanted it to be a surprise the audience. Farhan\\'s sister, Zoya, was in charge of the casting of the film.\\n\\nFilming\\nDil Chahta Hai was made on a budget of ₹80 million (US$1.0 million). Filming started in 2000 and was completed in 108 days by Ravi K. Chandran, taking place in Mumbai, Goa, and Sydney. While Arjun Bhasin did the costume design, Farah Khan and Yunus Pathan were the choreographer and art director, respectively; Suzanne Caplan Merwanji worked as the production designer. Finished by Nakul Kamte and H. Sridhar, the film was shot in sync sound—which means that the sound was recorded at the time of the shooting—making it one of the first Indian films to use the technique. A. Sreekar Prasad edited the film. In an interview with Filmfare magazine, he stated that he was initially skeptical of Farhan Akhtar, a newcomer director. However, he later changed his mind after finding him to be more professional than other directors he worked with. Prasad said that he felt excited editing the Dil Chahta Hai, stating that it reminded him of his college days and calling Dil Chahta Hai a \"revelation\" for him.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe soundtrack and background score of Dil Chahta Hai were composed by Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, after A. R. Rahman declined the offer due to date issues. The lyrics were penned by Javed Akhtar. The vocals were performed by Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik, Caralisa Monteiro, Srinivas, Shaan, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Mahadevan, Clinton Cerejo, KK, Harvey, and Sonu Nigam. Noorani stated that the trio went to Khandala along with Farhan Akhtar, Javed Akhtar, and Sidhwani to compose six songs from a total of nine for the film in three-and-a-half days. Mendonsa described the experience as 35% of work and 65% fun and added that they had a \"fantastic time\". After staying in Khandala, Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy subsequently booked a studio to finish the recording in three weeks.\\n\\nRelease\\nDil Chahta Hai was one of the most anticipated Indian films of the year, owing to its plot of youth rarely touched in Indian cinema. The one-minute-long trailer was released on television and film theatres (along with Aamir\\'s Lagaan) across India to increase audience enthusiasm and publicity from the media. Prior to its theatrical release, a special screening for Indian Home Minister L. K. Advani was held at his house in Delhi. The film premiered at theatres on 10 August 2001 and clashed with Deepak Shivdasani\\'s romantic drama Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke, also starring Zinta in the lead. Dil Chahta Hai was later screened in several film festivals: the 33rd International Film Festival of India, the 14th Palm Springs International Film Festival, and the 11th Austin Film Festival.Dil Chahta Hai was moderately successful at the box office, performing well in metropolitan areas, but failing in rural regions. Trade analysts attributed its commercial performance in rural regions to the city-oriented lifestyle depicted in the film. However, the film ran for more than 50 weeks, thereby becoming a golden jubilee film. It was released on 210 screens in India and grossed ₹9 million (US$110,000) on its opening day. It collected ₹27.7 million (US$350,000) by the end of its first weekend, and ₹57.3 million (US$720,000) after its first week. The film earned ₹332.8 million (US$4.2 million) from the country, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing Indian film that year. Overseas, Dil Chahta Hai was a commercial success, collecting $210,000 in North America and $100,000 in Atlantic countries in its opening first weekend. The film collected ₹16.5 million (US$210,000), and grossed ₹64.4 million (US$810,000) after finishing its overseas theatrical run, making itself the seventh-highest-grossing Indian film of the year. Box Office India estimated it grossed ₹397.2 million (US$5.0 million) internationally.The television premiere of Dil Chahta Hai took place on 17 August 2002 on StarPlus. The film was released on DVD as a single-disc pack in the NTSC widescreen format on 14 December 2007, and the double-disc version was released simultaneously; Spark Entertainment distributed the latter. The film has been accessible for streaming on Amazon Prime Video and Netflix since 18 November 2016.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nDil Chahta Hai received widespread critical acclaim upon release, with praise for its fresh storyline, soundtrack, Farhan\\'s direction, cinematography, costumes and the performances of the cast. Several critics also noted that the film had a realistic portrayal of the modern Indian youth.In a 4-star review published by Bollywood Hungama, the critic and trade analyst Taran Adarsh declared the film a landmark for Aamir\\'s career. Adarsh considered the film to include the best performance of both Saif and Khanna\\'s careers. Film critic Sita Menon felt Farhan had made \"an impressive debut\" with the film, praising him for developing the characters \"very well\". Menon also considered Khanna\\'s performance \"rich\" and deep.Writing for Screen, Piroj Wadia called the film \"an amazing debut\" for Farhan, further commending his \"good\" script and \"fine\" direction, along with \"excellent\" cinematography from Chandran. Dinesh Raheja found the film to have a \"refreshingly wicked sense of humour\". He agreed with Adarsh\\'s opinion about Saif\\'s performance, stating that he \"brings the house down with his funny one-liners and seems to be having a whale of a time\". Both Wadia and Raheja also complimented Kapadia in her brief role, stating that she had shown her range and versatility. Ziya Us Salam called Dil Chahta Hai \"a rare film on male camaraderie, and bachelor bonding\". He applauded its depiction of urban youth\\'s lifestyle from middle and upper-middle-class families, adding that the film \"is a rare situational comedy which does not have to rely on facial contortions and banana peels to raise peals of laughter. Here the situations are almost normal with reactions of the three leading characters almost as natural.\"In a review carried by Filmfare, Arati Koppar hailed Dil Chahta Hai as a \"fabulous ... attempt\" for a directorial debut, claiming that Aamir was the best among the lead actors. Komal Nahta praised Zinta for \"[looking] glamorous and sexy and acts beautifully. The new look of all the four aforementioned actors only adds to the freshness.\" He also saw Kapadia suited her role despite her aged look, but panned Kulkarni\\'s \"wasted\" role. Apart from reviewing the performances, Nahta also expressed admiration for Farhan\\'s direction and took note of his ability to handle the narration \"with aplomb and belies the fact that this is his maiden attempt\". Jasdeep Singh Pannu from NDTV labelled Dil Chahta Hai as a \"wonderfully-crafted film\" with \"a melodramatic act, an element better kept to the conventional Bollywood movie\". While Zee Next asserted it as one of the greatest Bollywood films of the year, Saibal Chatterjee elaborated: \"Farhan demonstrates a style that is as sophisticated as it is impressive.

       " 'The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis. It is the first installment in the Matrix film series, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano, and depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix, a simulated reality that intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias \"Neo\", uncovers the truth, he joins a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix.\\nThe Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The Wachowskis\\' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film\\'s use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The film popularized terms such as red pill, and introduced a visual effect known as \"bullet time\", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally.\\nThe Matrix opened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value, and was a massive success at the box office, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and the fourth highest-grossing film of that year. At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film won all four categories it was nominated for, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing. The film was also the recipient of numerous other accolades, including Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects at the 53rd British Academy Film Awards, and the Wachowskis were awarded Best Director and Best Science Fiction Film at the 26th Saturn Awards. The film is considered to be among the greatest science fiction films of all time, and in 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"The film\\'s success led to two feature film sequels being released in 2003, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, which were also written and directed by the Wachowskis. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and an animated anthology film, The Animatrix, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film, titled The Matrix Resurrections, was released on December 22, 2021.\\n\\nPlot\\nAt an abandoned hotel, a police squad corners Trinity, who overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of suited Agents capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes.\\nComputer programmer Thomas Anderson, known by his hacking alias \"Neo\", is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix\". Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named Morpheus has the answers Neo seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith, arrives at Neo\\'s workplace in search of him. Though Morpheus attempts to guide Neo to safety, Neo surrenders rather than risk a dangerous escape. The Agents offer to erase Neo\\'s criminal record in exchange for his help with locating Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses to cooperate, they fuse his mouth shut, pin him down, and implant a robotic \"bug\" in his abdomen. Neo wakes up from what he believes to be a nightmare. Soon after, Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo.\\nMorpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: Taking the red pill, which will reveal the truth about the Matrix, or  the blue, which will make Neo forget everything and return to his former life. Neo takes the red pill, and his reality begins to distort, awakening in a liquid-filled pod among countless other pods, containing other humans. He is then brought aboard Morpheus\\'s flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the situation: In the early 21st century, a war broke out between humanity and intelligent machines. After humans blocked the machines\\' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion.\\nMorpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix\\'s simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix kills the physical body too and explains that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels eliminate rebels in the real world. Neo\\'s prowess during virtual training cements Morpheus\\'s belief that Neo is \"the One\", a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, a prophet-like program who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus\\'s life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, Agents and police ambush the group, tipped off by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who has betrayed Morpheus in exchange for a deal to be plugged back into the Matrix to live a comfortable life.\\nTo buy time for the others, Morpheus fights Smith and is captured. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders the other crew members as they lie unconscious. Before Cypher can kill Neo and Trinity, crew member Tank regains consciousness and kills him before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, which would allow them to destroy it. Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to those of the Agents.\\nAfter Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix, Smith ambushes and kills Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived, with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix; he easily defeats Smith, prompting the other Agents to flee and he leaves the Matrix just as the ship\\'s electromagnetic pulse disables the Sentinels. Back in the Matrix, Neo makes a telephone call, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible.\" He hangs up and flies away.\\n\\nCast\\nKeanu Reeves as Thomas Anderson/Neo: A computer programmer, born Thomas A. Anderson, who secretly operates as a hacker named Neo. Reeves described his character as someone who felt that something was wrong, and was searching for Morpheus and the truth to break free. Will Smith turned down the role of Neo to make Wild Wild West, because of skepticism over the film\\'s ambitious bullet time special effects. He later stated he was \"not mature enough as an actor\" at that time, and that if given the role, he \"would have messed it up\". Smith praised Reeves for his portrayal. Nicolas Cage also turned down the part because of \"family obligations\". Warner Bros. sought Brad Pitt or Val Kilmer for the role. When both declined, Leonardo DiCaprio initially accepted the role, but ultimately turned it down because he did not want to do a visual effects film directly after Titanic. The studio pushed for Reeves, who won the role over Johnny Depp, the Wachowskis\\' first choice. Lorenzo di Bonaventura stated that the screenplay was also sent to Sandra Bullock, with the suggestion of rewriting Neo as a female.\\nLaurence Fishburne as Morpheus: A human freed from the Matrix and captain of the Nebuchadnezzar. Fishburne stated that once he read the script, he did not understand why other people found it confusing. However, he doubted if the movie would ever be made, because it was \"so smart\". The Wachowskis instructed Fishburne to base his performance on the character Morpheus in Neil Gaiman\\'s Sandman comics. Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson and Val Kilmer were also considered for the part.\\nCarrie-Anne Moss as Trinity: A human freed by Morpheus, a crewmember of the Nebuchadnezzar, and later Neo\\'s romantic interest. After reading the script, Moss stated that at first, she did not believe she had to do the extreme acrobatic actions as described in the script. She also doubted how the Wachowskis would get to direct a movie with a budget so large, but after spending an hour with them going through the storyboard, she understood why some people would trust them. Moss mentioned that she underwent a three-hour physical test during casting, so she knew what to expect subsequently. The role made Moss, who later said, \"I had no career before. None.\" Janet Jackson was initially approached for the role but scheduling conflicts prevented her from accepting it. In an interview, she stated that turning down the role was difficult for her, so she later referenced The Matrix in the \\'Intro\\' and \\'Outro\\' interludes on her tenth studio album Discipline. Sandra Bullock, who was previously approached for the role of Neo, was also offered the role of Trinity, but she turned it down. Rosie Perez, Salma Hayek and Jada Pinkett Smith (who would later play Niobe in the sequels) auditioned for the role.\\nHugo Weaving as Agent Smith: A sentient \"Agent\" program of the Matrix whose purpose is to destroy Zion and stop humans from getting out of the Matrix. Unlike other Agents, he has ambitions to free himself from his duties. Weaving stated that he found the character amusing and enjoyable to play. He developed a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither robotic nor human, and also said that the Wachowskis\\' voices had influenced his voice in the film. When filming began, Weaving mentioned that he was excited to be a part of something that would extend him. Jean Reno was offered the role, but declined, unwilling to move to Australia for the production.\\nJoe Pantoliano as Cypher: Another human freed by Morpheus, and a crewmember of the Nebuchadnezzar, but one who regrets taking the red pill and seeks to be returned to the Matrix, later betraying the rebels to Agent Smith. Pantoliano had worked with the Wachowskis prior to appearing in The Matrix, starring in their 1996 film Bound.\\nMarcus Chong as Tank: The \"operator\" of the Nebuchadnezzar and Dozer\\'s brother; they are both \"natural\" (as opposed to bred) humans, born outside of the Matrix.\\nAnthony Ray Parker as Dozer: Pilot of the Nebuchadnezzar. He is Tank\\'s brother, and like him was born outside of the Matrix.\\nJulian Arahanga as Apoc: A freed human and a crew member on the Nebuchadnezzar.\\nMatt Doran as Mouse: A freed human and a programmer on the Nebuchadnezzar.\\nGloria Foster as The Oracle: A prophet who still resides in the Matrix, helping the freed humans with her foresight and wisdom.\\nBelinda McClory as Switch: A human freed by Morpheus, and a crew member of the Nebuchadnezzar.\\nPaul Goddard as Agent Brown: One of two sentient \"Agent\" programs in the Matrix, who works with Agent Smith to destroy Zion and stop humans from escaping the system.\\nRobert Taylor as Agent Jones: One of two sentient \"Agent\" programs in the Matrix who works with Agent Smith to destroy Zion and stop humans from escaping the system.\\nAda Nicodemou as DuJour: A reference to the White Rabbit in Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland.\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nIn 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the film Assassins to Warner Bros. Pictures. After Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures, Bound and The Matrix, in the contract. The first movie the Wachowskis directed, Bound, then became a critical success. Using this momentum, they later asked to direct The Matrix.In 1996, the Wachowskis pitched the role of Neo to Will Smith. Smith explained on his YouTube channel that the idea was for him to be Neo, while Morpheus was to be played by Val Kilmer. He later explained that he did not quite understand the concept and he turned down the role to instead film Wild Wild West.Producer Joel Silver soon joined the project. Although the project had key supporters, including Silver and Di Bonaventura, to influence the company, The Matrix was still a huge investment for Warner Bros., which had to invest $60 million to create a movie with philosophical themes and difficult special effects. The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce to draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film. The storyboard eventually earned the studio\\'s approval, and it was decided to film in Australia to make the most of the budget. Soon, The Matrix became a co-production of Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow Pictures. According to editor Zach Staenberg on the DVD audio commentary track, the production team sent an edit of the film\\'s first minutes (featuring Trinity\\'s encounter with police and Agents) to Warner executives, and secured Warner\\'s \"total support of the movie\" from then on.\\n\\nPre-production\\nThe cast were required to be able to understand and explain The Matrix. French philosopher Jean Baudrillard\\'s Simulacra and Simulation was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew. In early 1997, the Wachowskis had Reeves read Simulacra and Simulation, Kevin Kelly\\'s Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans\\'s ideas on evolutionary psychology even before they opened up the script, and eventually he was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved. Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process.The directors had long been admirers of Hong Kong action cinema, so they decided to hire the Chinese martial arts choreographer and film director Yuen Woo-ping to work on fight scenes. To prepare for the wire fu, the actors had to train hard for several months. The Wachowskis first scheduled four months for training, beginning in October 1997. Yuen was optimistic but then began to worry when he realized how unfit the actors were.Yuen let their body style develop and then worked with each actor\\'s strength. He built on Reeves\\'s diligence, Fishburne\\'s resilience, Weaving\\'s precision, and Moss\\'s feminine grace. Yuen designed Moss\\'s moves to suit her deftness and lightness. Prior to the pre-production, Reeves underwent a two-level fusion of his cervical (neck) spine due to spinal cord compression from a herniated disc (\"I was falling over in the shower in the morning\"). He was still recovering by the time of pre-production, but he insisted on training, so Yuen let him practice punches and lighter moves. Reeves trained hard and even requested training on days off. However, the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training. As a result, Reeves did not kick much in the film. Weaving had to undergo hip surgery after he sustained an injury during the training process.\\n\\nFilming\\nAll but a few scenes were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney, as well as in the city itself, although recognizable landmarks were not included in order to maintain the impression of a generic American city. The filming helped establish New South Wales as a major film production center. Filming began in March 1998 and wrapped in August 1998; principal photography took 118 days.Due to Reeves\\'s neck injury (see above), some of the action scenes had to be rescheduled to wait for his full recovery. As a result, the filming began with scenes that did not require much physical exertion, such as the scene in Thomas Anderson\\'s office, the interrogation room, or the car ride in which Neo is taken to see the Oracle. Locations for these scenes included Martin Place\\'s fountain in Sydney, half-way between it and the adjacent Colonial Building, and the Colonial Building itself. During the scene set on a government building rooftop, the team filmed extra footage of Neo dodging bullets in case the bullet time process did not work. The bullet-time fight scene was filmed on the roof of Symantec Corporation building in Kent Street, opposite Sussex Street.Moss performed the shots featuring Trinity at the beginning of the film and all the wire stunts herself. The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production of Dark City, which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films. During the rehearsal of the lobby scene, in which Trinity runs on a wall, Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take. She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated when she realized that she would be unable to do it.The dojo set was built well before the actual filming. During the filming of these action sequences, there was significant physical contact between the actors, earning them bruises. Reeves\\'s injury and his insufficient training with wires prior to filming meant he was unable to perform the triple kicks satisfactorily and became frustrated with himself, causing the scene to be postponed. The scene was shot successfully a few days later, with Reeves using only three takes. Yuen altered the choreography and made the actors pull their punches in the last sequence of the scene, creating a training feel.The filmmakers originally planned to shoot the subway scene in an actual subway station, but the complexity of the fight and related wire work required shooting the scene on a set. The set was built around an existing train storage facility, which had real train tracks. Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling, Chad Stahelski, Reeves\\'s stunt double, sustained several injuries, including broken ribs, knees, and a dislocated shoulder. Another stuntman was injured by a hydraulic puller during a shot in which Neo was slammed into a booth. The office building in which Smith interrogated Morpheus was a large set, and the outside view from inside the building was a large, three story high cyclorama. The helicopter was a full-scale light-weight mock-up suspended by a wire rope operated a tilting mechanism mounted to the studio roofbeams. The helicopter had a real minigun side-mounted to it, which was set to cycle at half its regular (3,000 rounds per min) firing rate.To prepare for the scene in which Neo wakes up in a pod, Reeves lost 15 pounds and shaved his whole body to give Neo an emaciated look. The scene in which Neo fell into the sewer system concluded the principal photography. According to The Art of the Matrix, at least one filmed scene and a variety of short pieces of action were omitted from the final cut of the film.\\n\\nSound effects and music\\nDane A. Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film. The fight scene sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches, were created using thin metal rods and recording them, then editing the sounds. The sound of the pod containing a human body closing required almost fifty sounds put together.The film\\'s score was composed by Don Davis. He noted that mirrors appear frequently in the film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus\\'s glasses; Neo\\'s capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity\\'s motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas. Davis\\' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.\\nIn addition to Davis\\' score, The Matrix soundtrack also features music from acts such as Rammstein, Rob Dougan, Rage Against the Machine, Propellerheads, Ministry, Lunatic Calm, Deftones, Monster Magnet, The Prodigy, Rob Zombie, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Marilyn Manson.\\n\\nProduction design\\nIn the film, the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters. This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley, which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and Arabic numerals. In a 2017 interview at CNET, he attributed the design to his wife, who is from Japan, and added, \"I like to tell everybody that The Matrix\\'s code is made out of Japanese sushi recipes\". \"The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors\". Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic, supervised the creation of the film\\'s opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsay Fleay and Justen Marshall. The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film, Ghost in the Shell, which had a strong influence on the Matrix series. It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the game The Matrix: Path of Neo, and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the Matrix series. The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence.The Matrix\\'s production designer, Owen Paterson, used methods to distinguish the \"real world\" and the Matrix in a pervasive way. The production design team generally placed a bias towards the Matrix code\\'s distinctive green color in scenes set within the simulation, whereas there is an emphasis on the color blue during scenes set in the \"real world\". In addition, the Matrix scenes\\' sets were slightly more decayed, monolithic, and grid-like, to convey the cold, logical and artificial nature of that environment. For the \"real world\", the actors\\' hair was less styled, their clothing had more textile content, and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors.The Nebuchadnezzar was designed to have a patched-up look, instead of clean, cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on productions such as Star Trek. The wires were made visible to show the ship\\'s working internals, and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as \"a marriage between Man and Machine\". For the scene when Neo wakes up in the pod connected to the Matrix, the pod was constructed to look dirty, used, and sinister. During the testing of a breathing mechanism in the pod, the tester suffered hypothermia in under eight minutes, so the pod had to be heated.Kym Barrett, costume designer, said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume. For example, Reeves\\'s office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable, disheveled, and out of place. Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume, and also had to consider the practicality of the acting. The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume, hang upside-down without people seeing up their clothing, and be able to work the wires while strapped into the harnesses. For Trinity, Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbed and reflected different types of light, and was eventually able to make Trinity\\'s costume mercury-like and oil-slick to suit the character. For the Agents, their costume was designed to create a secret service, undercover look, resembling the film JFK and classic men in black.The sunglasses, a staple of the film\\'s aesthetics, were commissioned for the film by designer Richard Walker from sunglasses maker Blinde Design.\\n\\nVisual effects\\nAs for artistic inspiration for bullet time, I would credit Otomo Katsuhiro, who co-wrote and directed Akira, which definitely blew me away, along with director Michel Gondry. His music videos experimented with a different type of technique called view-morphing and it was just part of the beginning of uncovering the creative approaches toward using still cameras for special effects. Our technique was significantly different because we built it to move around objects that were themselves in motion, and we were also able to create slow-motion events that \\'virtual cameras\\' could move around – rather than the static action in Gondry\\'s music videos with limited camera moves.\\nThe film is known for popularizing a visual effect known as \"bullet time\", which allows a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed. Bullet time has been described as \"a visual analogy for privileged moments of consciousness within the Matrix\", and throughout the film, the effect is used to illustrate characters\\' exertion of control over time and space. The Wachowskis first imagined an action sequence that slowed time while the camera pivoted rapidly around the subjects, and proposed the effect in their screenplay for the film. When John Gaeta read the script, he pleaded with an effects producer at Mass.Illusion to let him work on the project, and created a prototype that led to him becoming the film\\'s visual effects supervisor.The method used for creating these effects involved a technically expanded version of an old art photography technique known as time-slice photography, in which an array of cameras are placed around an object and triggered simultaneously. Each camera captures a still picture, contributing one frame to the video sequence, which creates the effect of \"virtual camera movement\"; the illusion of a viewpoint moving around an object that appears frozen in time.The bullet time effect is similar but slightly more complicated, incorporating temporal motion so that rather than appearing totally frozen, the scene progresses in slow and variable motion. The cameras\\' positions and exposures were previsualized using a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect. When the frames were put together, the resulting slow-motion effects reached a frame frequency of 12,000 per second, as opposed to the normal 24 frames per second of film. Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side. To create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture.\\nThe photo-realistic surroundings generated by this method were incorporated into the bullet time scene, and algorithms based on optical flow were used to interpolate between the still images to produce a fluent dynamic motion; the computer-generated \"lead in\" and \"lead out\" slides were filled in between frames in sequence to get an illusion of orbiting the scene. Manex Visual Effects used a cluster farm running the Unix-like operating system FreeBSD to render many of the film\\'s visual effects.Manex also handled creature effects, such as Sentinels and machines in real world scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent at the end of the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo\\'s jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.The photogrammetric and image-based computer-generated background approaches in The Matrix\\'s bullet time evolved into innovations unveiled in the sequels The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The method of using real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models eventually led the visual effect team to digitize all data, such as scenes, characters\\' motions and expressions. It also led to the development of \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution. With these highly detailed collected data, the team were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras.\\n\\nRelease\\nHome media\\nThe Matrix was released on DVD and Laserdisc in its original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 on September 21, 1999, in the US from Warner Home Video as well as in 1.33:1 aspect ratio in Hong Kong from ERA Home Entertainment. It was also released on VHS in both full screen and widescreen formats followed on December 7, 1999. After its DVD release, it was the first DVD to sell more than one million copies in the US. By 2000, the film went on to become the first to sell more than three million copies in the US. At that point, it became the top-selling DVD release of all time, holding this record for a few months before being surpassed by Gladiator. By November 10, 2003, one month after The Matrix Reloaded DVD was released, the sales of The Matrix DVD had exceeded 30 million copies. It then debuted on both VHS and DVD formats in the UK on November 29, 1999. The Matrix sold more than 107,000 DVD copies in just two weeks, breaking Armageddon\\'s record for becoming the country\\'s best-selling DVD title. The Ultimate Matrix Collection was released on HD DVD on May 22, 2007 and on Blu-ray on October 14, 2008. The film was also released standalone in a 10th anniversary edition Blu-ray in the Digibook format on March 31, 2009, 10 years to the day after the film was released theatrically. In 2010, the film had another DVD release along with the two sequels as The Complete Matrix Trilogy. It was also released on 4K HDR Blu-ray on May 22, 2018. The film as part of The Matrix Trilogy was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 30, 2018.\\n\\nOther media\\nThe franchise also contains three video games: Enter the Matrix (2003), which contains footage shot specifically for the game and chronicles events taking place before and during The Matrix Reloaded; The Matrix Online (2004), an MMORPG which continued the story beyond The Matrix Revolutions; and The Matrix: Path of Neo (2005), which focuses on Neo\\'s journey through the trilogy of films.The franchise also includes The Matrix Comics, a series of comics and short stories set in the world of The Matrix, written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry. Most of the comics were originally presented for free on the official Matrix website; they were later republished, along with some new material, in two printed trade paperback volumes, called The Matrix Comics, Vol 1 and Vol 2.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nThe Matrix grossed $27.8 million during its opening weekend, as well as earning $34.7 million in its first five days. It surpassed Lost in Space and Indecent Proposal for having the biggest April and Easter opening weekends. The film also had the second-highest opening weekend for a spring starter film, trailing only behind Liar Liar. Three years later in 2002, The Matrix\\'s records for having the largest April and Easter opening weekends would be taken by The Scorpion King and Panic Room. Upon its opening, it had the highest opening weekend of any 1999 film, easily topping Payback. Additionally, this was the biggest opening weekend for a Keanu Reeves film since Speed in 1994. It was also ranked number one at the box office ahead of Forces of Nature. The film would remain at the top of the box office for two weeks until it was overtaken by Life. During its fourth weekend, The Matrix briefly returned to the number one spot. The following week, the film would be displaced by Entrapment.In its original run, the film earned $171,479,930 (37.0%) in the United States and Canada and $292,037,453 (63.0%) in other countries, for a worldwide total of $463,517,383. In North America, it went on to become the fifth highest-grossing film of 1999 and the highest-grossing R-rated film of that year. Worldwide, it was the fourth highest-grossing film of the year, after Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, The Sixth Sense and Toy Story 2. The Matrix became the second-highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of all time, behind Twister. Overall, it was the third-highest-grossing R-rated film at the time, just after Saving Private Ryan and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Following re-releases, the worldwide gross of the film is $466,621,824. In 2012, it was placed 122nd on the list of highest-grossing films of all time, and the second highest-grossing film in the Matrix franchise after The Matrix Reloaded ($742.1 million).\\n\\nCritical response\\nThe Matrix was praised by many critics, as well as filmmakers, and authors of science fiction, especially for its \"spectacular action\" scenes and its \"groundbreaking special effects\". Some have described The Matrix as one of the best science fiction films of all time; Entertainment Weekly called The Matrix \"the most influential action movie of the generation\". There have also been those, including philosopher William Irwin, who have suggested that the film explores significant philosophical and spiritual themes. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 161 reviews, with an average score of 7.8/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Thanks to the Wachowskis\\' imaginative vision, The Matrix is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects\". At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received a score of 73 based on 35 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale. It ranked 323rd among critics, and 546th among directors, in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made.Philip Strick commented in Sight & Sound, if the Wachowskis \"claim no originality of message, they are startling innovators of method,\" praising the film\\'s details and its \"broadside of astonishing images\". Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four: he praised the film\\'s visuals and premise, but disliked the third act\\'s focus on action. Similarly, Time Out praised the \"entertainingly ingenious\" switches between different realities, Hugo Weaving\\'s \"engagingly odd\" performance, and the film\\'s cinematography and production design, but concluded, \"the promising premise is steadily wasted as the film turns into a fairly routine action pic ... yet another slice of overlong, high concept hokum.\"Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader reviewed the film negatively, criticizing it as \"simpleminded fun for roughly the first hour, until the movie becomes overwhelmed by its many sources ... There\\'s not much humor to keep it all life-size, and by the final stretch it\\'s become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome.\"Ian Nathan of Empire described Carrie-Anne Moss as \"a major find\", praised the \"surreal visual highs\" enabled by the bullet time (or \"flo-mo\") effect, and described the film as \"technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool\". Nathan remarked that although the film\\'s \"looney plot\" would not stand up to scrutiny, that was not a big flaw because \"The Matrix is about pure experience\". Maitland McDonagh said in her review for TV Guide, the Wachowskis\\' \"through-the-looking-glass plot... manages to work surprisingly well on a number of levels: as a dystopian sci-fi thriller, as a brilliant excuse for the film\\'s lavish and hyperkinetic fight scenes, and as a pretty compelling call to the dead-above-the-eyeballs masses to unite and cast off their chains... This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark, pulpy sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits.\"Salon\\'s reviewer Andrew O\\'Hehir acknowledged that although The Matrix is in his view a fundamentally immature and unoriginal film (\"It lacks anything like adult emotion... all this pseudo-spiritual hokum, along with the over-ramped onslaught of special effects—some of them quite amazing—will hold 14-year-old boys in rapture, not to mention those of us of all ages and genders who still harbor a 14-year-old boy somewhere inside\"), he concluded, \"as in Bound, there\\'s an appealing scope and daring to the Wachowskis\\' work, and their eagerness for more plot twists and more crazy images becomes increasingly infectious. In a limited and profoundly geeky sense, this might be an important and generous film. The Wachowskis have little feeling for character or human interaction, but their passion for movies—for making them, watching them, inhabiting their world—is pure and deep.\"Filmmakers and science fiction creators alike generally took a complimentary perspective of The Matrix. William Gibson, a key figure in cyberpunk fiction, called the film \"an innocent delight I hadn\\'t felt in a long time,\" and stated, \"Neo is my favourite-ever science fiction hero, absolutely.\" Joss Whedon called the film \"my number one\" and praised its storytelling, structure and depth, concluding, \"It works on whatever level you want to bring to it.\" Darren Aronofsky commented, \"I walked out of The Matrix ... and I was thinking, \\'What kind of science fiction movie can people make now?\\' The Wachowskis basically took all the great sci-fi ideas of the 20th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured.\" M. Night Shyamalan expressed admiration for the Wachowskis, stating, \"Whatever you think of The Matrix, every shot is there because of the passion they have! You can see they argued it out!\". Simon Pegg said that The Matrix provided \"the excitement and satisfaction that The Phantom Menace failed to inspire. The Matrix seemed fresh and cool and visually breathtaking; making wonderful, intelligent use of CGI to augment the on-screen action, striking a perfect balance of the real and the hyperreal. It was possibly the coolest film I had ever seen.\" Quentin Tarantino counted The Matrix as one of his twenty favorite movies from 1992 to 2009. James Cameron called it \"one of the most profoundly fresh science fiction films ever made\". Christopher Nolan described it as \"an incredibly palpable mainstream phenomenon that made people think, Hey, what if this isn\\'t real?\"\\n\\nAccolades\\nThe Matrix received Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. The filmmakers were competing against other films with established franchises, like Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, yet they won all four of their nominations. The Matrix also received BAFTA awards for Best Sound and Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects, in addition to nominations in the cinematography, production design and editing categories. In 1999, it won Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction. In February 2022, the film was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\\' \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest, for the \"bullet time\" scene, finishing in fifth place.\\n\\nAwards and nominations\\nThematic analysis\\nThe Matrix draws from and alludes to numerous cinematic and literary works, and concepts from mythology, religion and philosophy, including the ideas of Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, Hinduism, and Judaism.\\n\\nFilm and television\\nThe pods in which the machines keep humans have been compared to images in Metropolis, and the work of M. C. Escher. A resemblance to the eery worlds of Swiss artist H.R. Giger was also recognized. The pods can be seen in Welcome to Paradox Episode 4 \"News from D Street\" from a 1986 short story of the same name by Andrew Weiner which aired on September 7, 1998, on the SYFY Channel and has a remarkably similar concept. In this episode the hero is unaware he is living in virtual reality until he is told so by \"the code man\" who created the simulation and enters it knowingly. The Wachowskis have described Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey as a formative cinematic influence, and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when making The Matrix. Rainer Werner Fassbinders German TV Miniseries World on a Wire from 1973, an adaption of the novel Simulacron-3, served as inspirational source for some details of The Matrix, such as the transfer between the real world and the Matrix-simulation via telephone / phonebooth. Reviewers have also commented on similarities between The Matrix and other late-1990s films such as Strange Days, Dark City, and The Truman Show. The similarity of the film\\'s central concept to a device in the long-running series Doctor Who has also been noted. As in the film, the Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial The Deadly Assassin) is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality. The action scenes of The Matrix were also strongly influenced by live-action films such as those of director John Woo. The martial arts sequences were inspired by Fist of Legend, a critically acclaimed 1995 martial arts film starring Jet Li. The fight scenes in Fist of Legend led to the hiring of Yuen as fight choreographer.The Wachowskis\\' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation such as Ninja Scroll and Akira. Director Mamoru Oshii\\'s 1995 animated film Ghost in the Shell was a particularly strong influence; producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for The Matrix by showing him that anime and saying, \"We wanna do that for real\". Mitsuhisa Ishikawa of Production I.G, which produced Ghost in the Shell, noted that the anime\\'s high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, \"... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I\\'d imagine that The Matrix is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios\". He stated that since Ghost in the Shell had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a \"promotional tool\".\\n\\nLiterary works\\nThe film makes several references to Lewis Carroll\\'s Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland. Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison\\'s comic series The Invisibles, with Morrison describing it in 2011 as \"(it) seemed to me (to be) my own combination of ideas enacted on the screen\". Comparisons have also been made between The Matrix and the books of Carlos Castaneda.The Matrix belongs to the cyberpunk genre of science fiction, and draws from earlier works in the genre such as the 1984 novel Neuromancer by William Gibson. For example, the film\\'s use of the term \"Matrix\" is adopted from Gibson\\'s novel, though L. P. Davies had already used the term \"Matrix\" fifteen years earlier for a similar concept in his 1969 novel The White Room (\"It had been tried in the States some years earlier, but their \\'matrix\\' as they called it hadn\\'t been strong enough to hold the fictional character in place\"). After watching The Matrix, Gibson commented that the way that the film\\'s creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was \"exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis\" he had relied upon in his own writing; however, he noted that the film\\'s Gnostic themes distinguished it from Neuromancer, and believed that The Matrix was thematically closer to the work of science fiction author Philip K. Dick, particularly Dick\\'s speculative Exegesis. Other writers have also commented on the similarities between The Matrix and Dick\\'s work; one example of such influence is a Philip K. Dick\\'s 1977 conference, in which he stated: \"We are living in a computer-programmed reality, and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed, and some alteration in our reality occurs\".\\n\\nPhilosophy\\nIn The Matrix, a copy of Jean Baudrillard\\'s philosophical work Simulacra and Simulation, which was published in French in 1981, is visible on-screen as \"the book used to conceal disks\", and Morpheus quotes the phrase \"desert of the real\" from it. \"The book was required reading\" for the actors prior to filming. However, Baudrillard himself said that The Matrix misunderstands and distorts his work. Some interpreters of The Matrix mention Baudrillard\\'s philosophy to support their claim \"that the [film] is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries\". The influence of The Matrixial Gaze, the philosophical-psychoanalytical concept of Bracha L. Ettinger on the archaic matrixial space that resists the field of simulacra, \"was brought to the public\\'s attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel\". In addition to Baudrillard and Ettinger, the Wachowskis were also significantly influenced by Kevin Kelly\\'s Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans’s ideas on evolutionary psychology.Philosopher William Irwin suggests that the idea of the \"Matrix\" – a generated reality invented by malicious machines – is an allusion to Descartes\\' \"First Meditation\", and his idea of an evil demon. The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise can be found in Hilary Putnam\\'s brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. A connection between the premise of The Matrix and Plato\\'s Allegory of the Cave has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato\\'s theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.The philosophy of Immanuel Kant has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his Critique of Pure Reason that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith\\'s monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human utopia, a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.\\n\\nReligion and mythology\\nAndrew Godoski sees allusions to Christ, including Neo\\'s \"virgin birth\", his doubt in himself, the prophecy of his coming, along with many other Christian references. Amongst these possible allusions, it is suggested that the name of the character Trinity refers to Christianity\\'s doctrine of the Trinity. It has also been noted that the character Morpheus paraphrases the Chinese taoist philosopher Zhuangzi when he asks Neo, \"Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference from the real world and the dream world?\"Matrixism is a fan-based possibly satirical religion created as \"the matrix religion\".\\n\\nTransgender themes\\nYears after the release of The Matrix, both the Wachowskis came out as transgender women, and some viewers have seen transgender themes in the film before it was officially confirmed. The red pill has been compared with red estrogen pills. Morpheus\\'s description of the Matrix creating a sense that something is fundamentally wrong, \"like a splinter in your mind\", has been compared to gender dysphoria. In the original script, Switch was a woman in the Matrix and a man in the real world, but this idea was ultimately dropped.In a 2016 GLAAD Media Awards speech, Lilly Wachowski said: \"There\\'s a critical eye being cast back on Lana and I\\'s (sic) work through the lens of our transness. This is a cool thing because it\\'s an excellent reminder that art is never static.\" She spoke in 2020 about the film as an allegory for transgender identity, and compromises they had to make at the time. In an interview with Variety, Reeves said he did not know the film was an allegory for transgender identity during production.\\n\\nLegacy\\nFilmmaking\\nFollowing The Matrix, films made abundant use of slow-motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them. The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including Max Payne, in which the feature was explicitly referred to as \"bullet time\". It was also the defining game mechanic of the game Superhot and its sequels. The Matrix\\'s signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have been parodied numerous times, in comedy films such as Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999), Scary Movie (2000), Shrek (2001), Kung Pow! Enter the Fist (2002), Lastikman (2003); Marx Reloaded in which the relationship between Neo and Morpheus is represented as an imaginary encounter between Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky;  and in video games such as Conker\\'s Bad Fur Day. It also inspired films featuring a black-clad hero, a sexy yet deadly heroine, and bullets ripping slowly through the air; these included Charlie\\'s Angels (2000) featuring Cameron Diaz floating through the air while the cameras flo-mo around her; Equilibrium (2002), starring Christian Bale, whose character wore long black leather coats like Reeves\\' Neo; Night Watch (2004), a Russian megahit heavily influenced by The Matrix and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who later made Wanted (2008), which also features bullets ripping through air; and Inception (2010), which centers on a team of sharply dressed rogues who are able to enter other people\\'s dreams by \"wiring in\". The original Tron (1982) paved the way for The Matrix, and The Matrix, in turn, inspired Disney to make its own Matrix with a Tron sequel, Tron: Legacy (2010). Also, the film\\'s lobby shootout sequence was recreated in the 2002 Indian action comedy Awara Paagal Deewana.\\n\\nChoreographers and actors\\nThe Matrix had a strong effect on action filmmaking in Hollywood. The film\\'s incorporation of wire fu techniques, including the involvement of fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by subsequent Hollywood action films, moving them towards more Eastern approaches. The success of The Matrix created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in X-Men (2000) and Charlie\\'s Angels (2000), and Yuen Woo-ping\\'s brother Yuen Cheung-yan was choreographer on Daredevil (2003). The Matrix\\'s Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) that they might not otherwise have had.Chad Stahelski, who had been a stunt double on The Matrix prior to directing Reeves in the John Wick series, acknowledged the film\\'s strong influence on the Wick films, and commented, \"The Matrix literally changed the industry. The influx of martial-arts choreographers and fight coordinators now make more, and are more prevalent and powerful in the industry, than stunt coordinators. The Matrix revolutionized that. Today, action movies want their big sequences designed around the fights.\"Carrie-Anne Moss asserted that prior to being cast in The Matrix, she had \"no career\". It launched Moss into international recognition and transformed her career; in a New York Daily News interview, she stated, \"The Matrix gave me so many opportunities. Everything I\\'ve done since then has been because of that experience. It gave me so much\". The film also created one of the most devoted movie fan-followings since Star Wars. The combined success of the Matrix trilogy, the Lord of the Rings films and the Star Wars prequels made Hollywood interested in creating trilogies. Stephen Dowling from the BBC noted that The Matrix\\'s success in taking complex philosophical ideas and presenting them in ways palatable for impressionable minds might be its most influential aspect.\\n\\nCultural impact\\nThe Matrix was also influential for its impact on superhero films. John Kenneth Muir in The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television called the film a \"revolutionary\" reimagination of movie visuals, paving the way for the visuals of later superhero films, and credits it with helping to \"make comic-book superheroes hip\" and effectively demonstrating the concept of \"faster than a speeding bullet\" with its bullet time effect. Adam Sternbergh of Vulture.com credits The Matrix with reinventing and setting the template for modern superhero blockbusters, and inspiring the superhero renaissance in the early 21st century.\\n\\nModern reception\\nIn 2001, The Matrix placed 66th in the American Film Institute\\'s \"100 Years...100 Thrills\" list. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly called The Matrix the best science-fiction piece of media for the past 25 years. In 2009, the film was ranked 39th on Empire\\'s reader-, actor- and critic-voted list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". The Matrix was voted as the fourth best science fiction film in the 2011 list Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time, based on a poll conducted by ABC and People. In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\" In 2022, The Matrix was determined the most popular tech-themed movie in the United States using search volume data.\\n\\nConspiracy theories and fringe groups\\nThe premise of The Matrix has been repurposed for multiple conspiracy theories and alt-right fringe groups. For example, some online men\\'s rights groups use the term \"redpill\" to mean men realizing that they are supposedly being subjugated by feminism. The term has been used in discussion forums for right-wing topics such as Gamergate, white supremacy, incel subculture and QAnon. As of 2021, the verb \"pill\" and adjective \"pilled\" had entered more mainstream use and had come to mean developing a sudden interest in something.\\n\\nSequels and adaptations\\nThe film\\'s mainstream success led to the making of two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, both directed by the Wachowskis. These were filmed back-to-back in one shoot and released on separate dates in 2003. The first film\\'s introductory tale is succeeded by the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of Zion by a vast machine army.  The sequels also incorporate longer and more ambitious action scenes, as well as improvements in bullet time and other visual effects.Also released was The Animatrix, a collection of nine animated short films, many of which were created in the same Japanese animation style that was a strong influence on the live action trilogy. The Animatrix was overseen and approved by the Wachowskis, who only wrote four of the segments themselves but did not direct any of them; much of the project was developed by notable figures from the world of anime.In March 2017, Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise with Zak Penn in talks to write a treatment and interest in getting Michael B. Jordan attached to star. According to The Hollywood Reporter neither the Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved with the endeavor, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of the Wachowskis. On August 20, 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich officially announced that a fourth Matrix film was in the works, with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss set to reprise their roles as Neo and Trinity respectively. The Matrix Resurrections was released on December 22, 2021, in theaters and on HBO Max.\\nIn September 2022, Danny Boyle was announced to be directing a dance adaptation of the film, titled \"Free Your Mind\", and it is set to debut in October 2023 in Manchester, U.K.\\n\\nSee also\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nBibliography\\nBabenko, Yelyzaveta (2011).

       " 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a 1991 American science-fiction action film directed by James Cameron, who co-wrote the script with William Wisher. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, and Edward Furlong, it is the sequel to The Terminator (1984) and is the second installment in the Terminator franchise. In the film, the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a Terminator—a highly advanced killing machine—back in time to 1995 to kill the future leader of the human resistance John Connor, when he is a child. The resistance sends back a less-advanced, reprogrammed Terminator to protect Connor and ensure the future of humanity.\\nThe Terminator was considered a significant success, enhancing Schwarzenegger\\'s and Cameron\\'s careers, but work on a sequel stalled because of animosity between the pair and Hemdale Film Corporation, which partially owned the film\\'s rights. In 1990, Schwarzenegger and Cameron persuaded Carolco Pictures to purchase the rights from The Terminator producer Gale Anne Hurd and Hemdale, which was financially struggling. A release date was set for the following year, leaving Cameron and Wisher seven weeks to write the script. Principal photography began from October 1990 to March 1991, taking place in and around Los Angeles on an estimated $94–102 million budget, making it the most-expensive film made at the time. The advanced visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), which include the first use of a computer-generated main character in a blockbuster film, resulted in a schedule overrun. Theatrical prints were not delivered to theaters until the night before its July 3, 1991 release.\\nTerminator 2 earned $519–520.9 million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1991 worldwide, and the third highest-grossing film of its time. Critics praised the visual effects, action sequences and cast, especially Patrick\\'s performance as the T-1000 as a great cinematic villain, while criticism was directed towards the film\\'s violence. Terminator 2 won several accolades, including Saturn, BAFTA, and Academy awards. Terminator 2 merchandise includes video games, comic books, novels, and T2-3D: Battle Across Time, a live-action attraction.\\nTerminator 2 is considered one of the best films ever made, and one of the best science-fiction, action, and sequel films, as well as equal to or better than The Terminator. It is also seen as one of the most influential visual effects films of all time, beginning the transition from practical effects to reliance on computer-generated imagery. Although Cameron intended for Terminator 2 to be the end of the franchise, it was followed by a series of sequels, including Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Salvation (2009), Terminator Genisys (2015), and Terminator: Dark Fate (2019), as well as a 2008 television series.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 2029, Earth has been ravaged by the war between the malevolent artificial intelligence (AI) Skynet and the human resistance. Skynet sends the T-1000—an advanced, prototype, shape-shifting Terminator made of virtually indestructible liquid metal—back in time to kill the resistance leader John Connor when he is a child. To protect Connor, the resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator, a less-advanced metal endoskeleton covered in synthetic flesh.\\nIn 1995 Los Angeles, John\\'s mother Sarah has been incarcerated at the Pescadero State Hospital for her violent, fanatical efforts to prevent \"Judgment Day\"—the prophesied events of August 29, 1997, when Skynet will gain sentience and, responding its creators\\' attempts to deactivate it, incite a nuclear holocaust. John, taken in by his foster parents, considers Sarah\\'s beliefs to be delusional and resents her efforts to prepare him for his future role.\\nThe T-800 and the T-1000 converge on John in a shopping mall and a chase ensues. John and the T-800 escape together. John calls to warn his foster parents but the T-800 deduces the T-1000 has already killed them. Realizing the T-800 is programmed to obey him, John forbids it from killing people and orders it to save Sarah from the T-1000. The T-800 and John intercept Sarah during an escape attempt but Sarah flees because the T-800 resembles the Terminator that was sent to kill her in 1984. John and the T-800 persuade her to join them, and they escape the pursuing T-1000. Although distrustful of the T-800, Sarah uses its knowledge of the future to learn that a revolutionary microprocessor, being developed by Cyberdyne Systems engineer Miles Dyson, will be crucial to Skynet\\'s creation.\\nOver the course of their journey, Sarah sees the T-800 serving as a friend and father figure to John, who teaches it catchphrases and hand signs while encouraging it to become more human-like. Sarah plans to flee with John to Mexico until a nightmare about Judgment Day convinces her to kill Dyson, whom she assaults in his home, but finds she cannot kill him and relents. John arrives and reconciles with Sarah while the T-800 convinces Dyson of the future consequences of his work. Dyson reveals his research has been reverse engineered from the damaged CPU and severed arm of the 1984 Terminator. Believing his work must be destroyed, Dyson, Sarah, John, and the T-800 break into Cyberdyne, retrieve the CPU and the arm, and set explosives to destroy the lab. The police assault the building and fatally shoot Dyson, but he detonates the explosives as he dies. The T-1000 pursues the surviving trio, cornering them in a steel mill.\\nSarah and John split up to escape while the T-1000 mangles the T-800 and briefly deactivates it by destroying its power source. The T-1000 assumes Sarah\\'s appearance to lure out John but Sarah intervenes and, along with the reactivated T-800, shoots it into a vat of molten steel and it disintegrates. The T-800 explains it must also be destroyed along with the CPU and severed arm to prevent it from serving as a foundation for Skynet. Despite John\\'s tearful protests, the T-800 persuades him its destruction is the only way to protect their future. Sarah shakes the T-800\\'s hand and, having come to respect it, helps lower it into the vat. Before its destruction, the T-800 gives John a thumbs-up. As Sarah drives down a highway with John, she reflects on her renewed hope for an unknown future, musing if the T-800 could learn the value of life, so can humanity.\\n\\nCast\\nArnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator: a reprogrammed Model 101 Series 800 \"T-800\" Terminator that is composed of living tissue over a metal endoskeleton\\nLinda Hamilton as Sarah Connor: a self-trained soldier who is dedicated to preventing the rise of Skynet\\nEdward Furlong as John Connor: Sarah\\'s son who is destined to lead the human resistance in opposition to Skynet\\nRobert Patrick as T-1000: an advanced, shape-shifting, prototype Terminator that is composed of liquid metal\\nEarl Boen as Dr. Silberman: Sarah\\'s doctor at Pescadero State Hospital\\nJoe Morton as Miles Bennett Dyson: Director of special projects at Cyberdyne Systems CorporationThe film\\'s cast also includes Jenette Goldstein and Xander Berkeley as John\\'s foster parents Janelle and Todd Voight; Cástulo Guerra as Sarah\\'s friend Enrique Salceda; S. Epatha Merkerson and DeVaughn Nixon as Dyson\\'s wife Tarissa and son Danny; and Danny Cooksey as John\\'s friend Tim. Hamilton\\'s twin sister Leslie Hamilton Gearren appears as the T-1000 impersonating Sarah when Hamilton is also on-screen. Twins Don and Dan Stanton portray a guard at Pescadero State Hospital and the T-1000 imitating him.Other cast members includes Ken Gibbel as an abusive orderly; Robert Winley, Ron Young, Charles Robert Brown, and Pete Schrum as men who confront the T-800 in a biker bar; Abdul Salaam El Razzac as Gibbons, a Cyberdyne guard; and Dean Norris as the SWAT team leader. Michael Edwards portrays the John Connor of 2029 and Hamilton\\'s twenty-month-old son Dalton Abbott portrays an infant John in a dream sequence. Co-writer William Wisher cameos as a man photographing the T-800 in the mall, and Michael Biehn reprises his role as resistance soldier Kyle Reese in scenes that were removed from the theatrical release.\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nThe Terminator had been a surprise hit, earning $78.4 million against its $6.4 million budget, confirming Schwarzenegger\\'s status as a lead actor and making director James Cameron a credible director. Schwarzenegger expressed interest in a sequel, saying \"I always felt we should continue the story ... I told [Cameron] that right after we finished the first film.\" Cameron said Schwarzenegger had always been more enthusiastic about a sequel than he was, because he had said everything he wanted to with the original.Discussions to make a sequel stalled until 1989, in part due to Cameron\\'s work on other films such as Aliens (1986) and The Abyss (1989), but also due to a fallout with rights holder Hemdale Film Corporation. Hemdale co-founder John Daly had attempted to alter the ending of The Terminator against Cameron\\'s wishes, nearly resulting in a physical confrontation. A sequel, however, could not be made without Hemdale\\'s approval; Cameron had surrendered 50% of his rights to the company to get The Terminator made. Cameron had also sold half of the remaining stake to his ex-wife Gale Anne Hurd, producer and co-writer on the first film, for $1 following their 1989 divorce. By 1990, Hemdale was being sued by Cameron, Schwarzenegger, Hurd, and special-effects artist Stan Winston for unpaid profits from The Terminator.Schwarzenegger, aware Hemdale was experiencing financial difficulties, persuaded Carolco Pictures to pursue the purchase of The Terminator rights, having worked with the independent film studio on the big-budget, science-fiction film Total Recall (1990). Owner Mario Kassar described the rights acquisition as the most-difficult deal Carolco ever conducted. He accepted a $10 million offer for Hemdale\\'s share, considering it a sum fabricated to ward him off, and paid Hurd $5 million for her share. Prior to development, the total cost of the acquisition came to $17 million after factoring in incidental costs.Kassar told Cameron that in order to recoup his investment, the film would proceed with or without him, offering Cameron $6 million to be involved and write the script. The film would become a collaboration between several production studios: Carolco, Le Studio Canal+, Cameron\\'s Lightstorm Entertainment, and Hurd\\'s Pacific Western Productions. The minimum estimated cost to produce Terminator 2 was $60 million, dwarfing the $6.5 million budget of the first film, but Kassar called it a \"ghost\" number; he was aware the figure would increase because of Cameron\\'s previous work. News sources labeled Terminator 2 the most-expensive independent film ever and predicted it would \"bankrupt Carolco\". However, Kassar claimed to have secured 110% of the budget funding needed through pre-sales to markets outside the US, as well as television, home-video, and theatrical distribution rights. The studio also had an existing US distribution deal with TriStar Pictures for a set percentage of the budget – an estimated $4 million. TriStar stipulated that the film be ready for release by May 27, 1991, Memorial Day.\\n\\nWriting\\nWith a set scheduled release date, Cameron had six-to-seven weeks to write the sequel; he approached his frequent collaborator and The Terminator co-writer William Wisher Jr. in March 1990. They spent two weeks developing a film treatment based on Cameron\\'s vision to form a relationship between John Connor and the T-800, a concept Wisher initially believed was a joke. Their treatment diverged from the \"science-fiction slasher\" theme of the original, instead focusing on the unconventional family bond formed between Sarah, John, and the T-800. Cameron said this relationship is \"the heart of the movie\", comparing it to the Tin Man receiving a heart in The Wizard of Oz (1939).Cameron\\'s initial concept had Skynet and the resistance each sending a T-800 – both played by Schwarzenegger – into the past; one to kill John and the other to protect him. Wisher believed a fight between two identical Terminators would be boring. The pair also briefly considered a larger \"Super-Terminator\", which ultimately did not keep their interest. Instead, they adopted an early idea Cameron had for The Terminator, which involved a liquid-metal Terminator that looked like an average human in contrast to Schwarzenegger\\'s large frame. The first half of the story would end with the destruction of Skynet\\'s T-800, forcing it to use the T-1000, its ultimate weapon. Although he once considered removing the T-1000 altogether, Cameron later solidified it as the only antagonist. Writers had the T-1000 take on the appearance of a police officer, allowing it to operate with less suspicion. Cameron added that the decision was also thematically relevant, comparing an authority figure to the human tendency to lose compassion and become machine-like. Wisher found it challenging to depict the T-800 as \"good\" without making it non-threatening at the same time. The pair decided to give it the ability to learn and develop emotions, becoming more human over time.Wisher developed the first half of the treatment at Cameron\\'s home over the course of four weeks, while Cameron worked on the latter half. Many pages were removed, including a \"convoluted\" subplot about Dyson and a massacre of a camp of survivalists helping Sarah. Cameron, who did not consider the budget while writing, had to cut some elaborate scenes, including a nine-minute opening that showed a time-travel machine being used in 2029. Wisher and Cameron also frequently conferred with special-effects studio Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to determine which ideas were achievable.Cameron and Wisher analyzed the first film to help envision each character\\'s development and evolution. Cameron believed Sarah\\'s knowledge of the future would isolate her, forcing her to associate with survivalists and become a self-sufficient commando. She was written to have become an emotionally cold and distant character comparable to a Terminator, especially when deciding to go after Dyson. Instead of beginning the story with Sarah, John is placed with a foster family to increase tension. John\\'s character was inspired by the 1985 Sting song, \"Russians\", with Cameron recalling, \"I remember sitting there once, high on E ... I was struck by [the lyrics] \\'I hope the Russians love their children too\\'. And I thought, \\'You know what? The idea of a nuclear war is just so antithetical to life itself\\'. That\\'s where [John] came from.\" Cameron wanted to make the Terminator a protagonist, because he found it uninteresting to repeat the character of The Terminator. They kept the T-800\\'s dialogue brief, relying on the audience to infer a lot of meaning through \"small bites\". Its catchphrase, \"Hasta la vista, baby\", was something Wisher and Cameron said after their telephone calls. They spent three days refining the script, and the printed copy was still warm when Cameron boarded Carolco\\'s charter jet on the way to Cannes, where Terminator 2 was announced in early May 1990. Schwarzenegger initially struggled with portions of the script, once asking \"What is \\'polyalloy\\'?\" He also expressed concern about the character\\'s non-lethal depiction, which appeared to conflict with his action-hero persona and his portrayal of the character in the first film. Cameron explained he wanted to defy audience expectations. Schwarzenegger requested: \"Just make me cool\".\\n\\nCasting\\nSchwarzenegger became interested in reprising his role after finding the character more complex and sympathetic than in the previous film, although he found portraying a fearless, emotionless machine difficult. He extensively rehearsed action scenes with stunt coordinator Joel Kramer to minimize the effects of fire and explosions occurring around him. Schwarzenegger earned $12–$15 million for his involvement. Carolco had been blamed for the increase in exorbitant salaries paid to actors, having paid Schwarzenegger around $11 million for Total Recall (1990). They justified the expense as the value of their leads\\' wide appeal in markets outside the U.S. To lessen the immediate financial burden, Carolco paid most of Schwarzenegger\\'s salary with a financed, $12.75 million Gulfstream III jet, allowing them to settle the fee over several years.Cameron refused to re-cast Hamilton\\'s role but developed plans to work around her absence if she chose not to return. Negotiations were initially protracted but were settled promptly after Cameron informed Carolco the script could not be finished until he knew if Hamilton would be involved. Hamilton received roughly $1 million, which she described as \"quite a bit more\" than her earnings for The Terminator but expressed disappointment at the pay disparity between her and Schwarzenegger. She requested Sarah to be \"crazy\", stating, \"I thought, \\'This woman has been living with the certainty of man\\'s demise for all these years and she\\'d have become this wild thing\\', so the warrior and the crazy woman ideas were all me\". She continued: \"[The T-800] is a better human than I am, and I\\'m a better Terminator than he is\". Cameron considered giving the character a facial scar but determined applying it daily would be difficult. Hamilton undertook extensive preparation for her role, working with a personal trainer for three hours a day, six days a week, and maintaining a strict, low-fat diet, losing about 12 pounds (5.4 kg) of body weight. She also received judo and military training from former Israeli commando Uziel Gal. Over the course of the six-month shoot, Hamilton also spent time each day with her twenty-month-old son Dalton and averaged only four hours of sleep at night. She described her experience as \"sheer Hell\" but enjoyed showing off her new physique. Hamilton\\'s twin sister, Leslie, was also cast in scenes where two versions of Sarah appear on-screen simultaneously.Patrick, who was living in his car, was one of several actors in their late 20s considered for the T-1000 role. Cameron wanted a lithe actor who could resemble a newly-recruited police officer to contrast with Schwarzenegger; according to Cameron, \"If the [T-800] series is a kind of human Panzer tank, then the [T-1000] series had to be a Porsche\". Casting director Mali Finn believed Patrick, whose agent described him as a cross of David Bowie and James Dean, had the \"intense presence\" they wanted. Patrick auditioned by acting like an emotionless hunter and later participated in a screen test to judge the way lighting worked with his skin and eyes. For his character, he drew inspiration from Schwarzenegger\\'s performance in The Terminator and observed the movement of hunting creatures – reptiles, insects, cats, and sharks. Patrick\\'s facial expressions were based on those of an eagle, keeping his head tilted down to imply constant forward movement. He also employed a mixture of military posture with martial arts to express a fluid motion that differed from the T-800\\'s rigid movements. The role demanded Patrick to be lean and fast, requiring peak physical shape. He learned to sprint without displaying heavy breathing and exhaustion, and like Hamilton, he received specialized training from Gal. Weapons master Harry Lu taught Patrick to operate and reload weapons, such as the T-1000\\'s Beretta 92FS, without looking and eventually without blinking. Singer Billy Idol was originally cast for the role before a motorbike accident seriously injured his leg. In a 2021 retrospective, Cameron said Idol had an interesting aesthetic but in hindsight, he probably would not have cast him. Singer Blackie Lawless of the rock band W.A.S.P. was also considered but deemed too tall.Cameron believed that early candidates for the role of John Connor were either overexposed in other media or came from advertisement backgrounds, which trained them to be happy and perky. Furlong had no acting experience and was discovered by Finn at the Boys & Girls Club in Pasadena. Cameron described Furlong as having a \"surliness, an intelligence, just a question of pulling it out\". Furlong, among hundreds of other prospects, secured the role at his last audition. He was required to take acting lessons, learn some Spanish, and be able to ride a motorcycle and repair guns. Joe Morton said he believed his casting as Miles Bennett Dyson had to do with Cameron wanting a minority character to be integral to the changing of the world. Morton avoided interacting with the cast so that their on-screen relationships would seem believably distant. The role of Dyson was reduced after the preferred casting choice, Denzel Washington, declined it; the role required him to act scared.\\n\\nFilming\\nThree months of pre-production was truncated to meet the release schedule, leaving Cameron without the time he wanted to prepare all aspects before filming began. Over one week, he spent several hours each day choreographing vehicle scenes with toy cars and trucks, filming the results, and printing the footage for storyboard artists. There was no time to properly test practical effects before filming; if effects did not work, the filmmakers had to work around them.Principal photography began on October 8–9, 1990, with a $60 million budget. The production was long and arduous, in part because of Cameron, who was known for his short temper, and uncompromising and \"dictatorial\" manner that resulted in the crew making T-shirts bearing the slogan \"You can\\'t scare me—I work for Jim Cameron.\" Schwarzenegger described him as a supportive but \"demanding taskmaster\" with a \"fanaticism for physical and visual detail\". Cameron had a practical approach when making scenes fit his vision; in one instance, he angrily fixed a broken camera when the operator could not, and Morton said during his death scene, Cameron decided on a whim to detonate surrounding glass to see how it would look. Because of the tight schedule, Cameron worked throughout Christmas, editing on Christmas Eve, and persuaded Schwarzenegger to cancel multiple Christmas events and a visit to American troops in Saudi Arabia with U.S. President George H. W. Bush to film his scenes. By the 101st day of filming, Schwarzenegger and Hamilton were frustrated by the number of takes Cameron ordered; five days were spent on Hamilton\\'s close-ups in scenes at the Dyson home. Scenes were filmed out of sequence to prioritize those requiring extensive visual effects; Schwarzenegger found this difficult because he was meant to convey subtle signs of the T-800\\'s progressive humanity and was unsure what was fitting for each scene. Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, who also worked on The Terminator, described the greater scope of the sequel as the most daunting prospect; where he had been able to shout instructions to his crew on the original film, he used one of 187 walkie-talkies to conduct efforts over an expansive area.\\n\\nThe production used many locations in and around California. The now-destroyed Corral bar in Sylmar is where the T-800 confronts a group of bikers. Location manager Jim Morris chose Corral because it was raised above ground, allowing the scene to take place over different levels. On one occasion, a woman who was oblivious to ongoing filming walked into the bar; when she asked Schwarzenegger, who was wearing only a pair of shorts, what was going on, he replied: \"It\\'s male-stripper night\". Executives suggested cutting the scene to save money but Cameron and Schwarzenegger refused.The T-1000 arrives at the Sixth Street Viaduct, John hacks an ATM at a bank in Van Nuys, and his foster parents\\' home is in the Canoga Park neighborhood—which was chosen because it looked generic. The Terminators confront John inside Santa Monica Place mall, although exterior shots were filmed at Northridge Fashion Center where there was less traffic. When the on-foot T-1000 chases John on a bicycle, Patrick\\'s training made him faster than the bicycle and so its speed was increased. The T-1000 pursues John and the T-800 in a truck at Bull Creek spillway in North Hills. Other locations include the Lake View Terrace hospital, which was used for Pescadero State Hospital, and Petersen Automotive Museum became its garage; Cactus Jack\\'s Market in Lancaster, California, Elysian Park—the site of Sarah\\'s apocalyptic dream—and Dyson\\'s home was near California State Route 1 in Malibu. The Cyberdyne Building destroyed in the film was an abandoned office in San Jose that was scheduled for demolition. Cameron used real Los Angeles Police Department SWAT members in the scene, although he embellished their real tactics for a more visually interesting assault.The final highway chase was filmed along the Terminal Island Freeway near Long Beach, of which a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) stretch was shut nightly for two weeks. The future war of 2029 was filmed in the rubble of an abandoned steel mill in Oxnard, California, in a space one-half square mile (1.3 km2) that was enhanced with burned bicycles and cars from a 1989 fire at the Universal Studios Lot, and with effects such as flying vehicles added in post-production. Terminator 2\\'s ending was filmed in the closed Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana, which Greenberg made appear operational mainly through lighting techniques. Despite appearing to be actively smelting steel, the mill was frigid and dangerous because of the moving machinery and high catwalks. The T-800\\'s thumbs-up during his death was added during filming; Hamilton believed it was too sentimental. Six months of filming concluded on March 28, 1991, about three weeks behind schedule. Hamilton described the production as the most \"difficult, exhausting, physically, and emotionally stressful experience of my life\". She suffered permanent partial hearing loss after forgetting to wear earplugs in the scene in which the T-800 fires a gun in the hospital elevator, and experienced shell shock from months of exposure to violence, loud noise, gunfire, and action set-pieces.\\n\\nPost-production\\nTerminator 2 was edited by Conrad Buff IV, Richard A. Harris, and Mark Goldblatt, who said although there was more time to edit than on The Terminator, it was still relatively small given the greater scope of the sequel; they described the complexity of scenes such as the final battle between the Terminators, which required a seamless combination of live-action, practical effect shots, and CGI. After having to rush editing at the end of The Abyss, Cameron limited filming on Terminator 2 to five days a week so he could edit the film on weekends from the start of filming. Several scenes were deleted, in part to reduce its running time; these include Kyle Reese appearing to Sarah in a dream and encouraging her to continue fighting; Sarah being beaten in the hospital; the T-1000 killing John\\'s dog (a scene the animal-loving Patrick was not a fan of); John teaching the T-800 to smile and discussing whether it fears death; the T-1000 malfunctioning after being frozen in the steel mill; and additional scenes with Dyson\\'s family. Schwarzenegger unsuccessfully rallied to retain his favorite scene, in which John and Sarah modify the T-800\\'s CPU, allowing it to learn and evolve. Sarah attempts to destroy the CPU but John defends the T-800. The scene was replaced with dialogue indicating the T-800 already possesses the ability to learn. The scripted ending depicted an alternative 2029 that was filmed at the Los Angeles Arboretum in Arcadia, in which an aged Sarah narrates how Skynet was never created while John, now a senator, plays with his daughter. To make the film more evocative and memorable, Cameron changed this scene to one in which the characters look out at the road ahead. The production ran until about two days before the film\\'s theatrical release; delays were mainly caused by the rendering of shots at Consolidated Film Industries, the most difficult of which was the T-1000\\'s death. Co-producer Stephanie Austin said the production crew worked twenty-four-hour shifts and slept on site. The release print was delivered to theaters the night before its release. The film runs for 137 minutes.Cameron and Schwarzenegger said the final budget, excluding marketing, was about $70 million, and the cost of making the film was about $51 million. According to Carolco executives Peter Hoffman and Roger Smith, the film cost $75 million figure before marketing, saying Terminator 2 was only \"modestly\" over budget. Including marketing and other costs, the film\\'s total budget is reported to be between $94 million and $102 million. This figure was reduced by advances and guarantees of $91 million, including North-American television ($7 million) and home-video ($10 million) rights, and $61 million from theatrical and television rights outside the U.S.\\n\\nSpecial effects and design\\nA 10-month schedule and about $15–$17 million of Terminator 2\\'s budget was allocated to the entirety of its special effects, including $5 million for the T-1000 alone, and a further $1 million for stunts, at the time one of the largest ever stunt budgets. Four main companies were involved in creating the 150 visual effects: ILM under special effects supervisor Dennis Muren managed the computer-generated imagery (CGI) effects, Stan Winston Studio the prosthetics and animatronics, Fantasy II Film Effects developed miniatures and optical effects, and 4-Ward Productions were responsible for creating a nuclear explosion effect. Pacific Data Images and Video Image provided some additional effects. The cost of producing CGI and practical limitations of staff numbers meant the effect was using sparingly, appearing in 42–43 shots, alongside 50–60 practical effects.Produced near the advent of CGI, vivifying the T-1000 was a risky endeavor as there was no backup plan in place if the CGI did not work as intended or could not be composited effectively with Winston\\'s practical effects. The computer systems needed to animate and render the T-1000 CGI cost thousands of dollars alone, but creating the character also relied on a variety of practical appliances, visual illusions, and filming techniques. A team of up to 35 at ILM were required for the five minutes of screen time the T-1000\\'s effects appear, and the process was so complex that rendering 15 seconds of footage would take up to ten days.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe Terminator composer Brad Fiedel returned for the sequel, working in his garage in Studio City, Los Angeles. Film industry professionals regarded his return with concern and skepticism; they believed his style would not suit the film. Fiedel quickly realized he would not receive the finished footage until late in the production after most effects were completed, which made it difficult to commit to decisions such as use of an orchestra because, unlike ambient music, the score had to accompany the on-screen action. Fiedel and Cameron wanted the musical tone to be \"warmer\" due to its focus on a nobler Terminator and young John. Fiedel experimented with sounds and shared them with Cameron for feedback.While The Terminator score had mainly used oscillators and synthesizers, Fiedel recorded real instruments and modified their sounds. He developed a library of sounds for characters such as the T-1000, whose theme was created by sampling brass-instrument players warming up and improvising. Fiedel said to the players, \"You\\'re an insane asylum. You\\'re a bedlam of instruments.\" He slowed down the resulting sample and lowered the pitch, describing it as \"artificial intelligent monks chanting\". Cameron considered the \"atonal\" sound \"too avant-garde\" for him but Fiedel justified it as an accompaniment to Cameron, who was making a film \"people have never seen before\".Tri-Star asked Schwarzenegger to arrange a tie-in music video and theme song for the film; he chose to work with rock band Guns N\\' Roses because they were popular and there was \"a rose in the movie and bloody guns\". The band offered the use of \"You Could Be Mine\", the debut single from their album Use Your Illusion II (1991). The music video, featuring Schwarzenegger as the T-800 pursuing the band, was directed by Stan Winston, Andrew Morahan, and Jeffrey Abelson. Patrick unsuccessfully lobbied to use \"Head Like a Hole\" by Nine Inch Nails as the tie-in song, in part because his brother, Richard Patrick, was their tour guitarist. Wisher suggested using \"Bad to the Bone\" by George Thorogood & the Destroyers as the T-800 puts on the biker clothes; although Cameron did not like the idea, Wisher said he later found Cameron had used the song but had forgotten it was his idea. \"Guitars, Cadillacs\" by Dwight Yoakam also features in Terminator 2.\\n\\nRelease\\nContext\\nCompetition between studios was expected to be strong during the summer theatrical season, which ran from mid-May to early September, with fifty-five films scheduled for release compared with thirty-seven in 1990. Release dates repeatedly changed as studios attempted to avoid strong competition and maximize their films\\' successes at a time when the cost of film production had increased 20% in a year, in part due to costly salaries for stars who also commanded a percentage of the film\\'s profits, and declining revenues from box-office receipts, video sales, and television-network deals. Films scheduled for release included City Slickers, The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear, Only the Lonely, Hudson Hawk, The Rocketeer, What About Bob?, and Point Break. The films most-expected to do well included Backdraft and Terminator 2, which were seen as having international appeal, Dying Young, and the year\\'s predicted top film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. An unnamed studio executive said audiences were seeking escapist entertainment such as comedy or action, and avoiding films about less-positive subject matter.\\n\\nMarketing and promotion\\nSchwarzenegger was involved in Terminator 2\\'s marketing and merchandising campaign, which was estimated to be worth at least $20 million. By 1991, advertising for Terminator 2 was ubiquitous with high audience recognition and despite its US R rating, restricting audiences to over 17s unless accompanied by an adult, the marketing was mainly aimed at younger audiences. Tristar contributed about $20 million for marketing, which included a $150,000 teaser trailer that was directed by Winston and depicts the construction of a T-800. Trailers ran for six months before the film\\'s release; Tristar incentivized cinema staff to play it frequently by offering chances to win Terminator 2-branded goods and tickets to the premiere. Collaborations with fast-food restaurants and soft-drink manufacturers such as Subway and Pepsi, were used to promote the film.There were two private screenings: one for family, friends, and crew at Skywalker Ranch and another in Los Angeles for studio executives. Austin said, \"People were stamping their feet and clapping for ten or fifteen minutes\", at which point the crew knew they had succeeded. During test screenings the ending was well-received, and was described as a \"touching\" favorite scene. The premiere took place on July 1, 1991, at the Cineplex Odeon in Century City, Los Angeles. According to Fiedel, it was treated as a major event, unlike the premiere of The Terminator, at which the audience was skeptical or laughed at the wrong times. Celebrities in attendance included Maria Shriver, Nicolas Cage, Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Michael Douglas, and Furlong\\'s date Soleil Moon Frye.\\n\\nBox office\\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day opened in the United States and Canada on July 3, leading into the Independence Day holiday weekend. It had the highest-grossing Wednesday opening  with $11.8 million. Between Friday and Sunday, the film grossed $31.8 million from 2,274 theaters, an average of $13,969 per theater, making it the number-one film of the weekend ahead of The Naked Gun 2½ ($11.6 million) in its second weekend and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ($10.3 million) in its fourth. Over the five-day holiday weekend (Wednesday to Sunday), Terminator 2 grossed $52.3 million, becoming the second-highest opening five-day total ever behind Batman\\'s $57 million in 1989, It set a record opening for an R-rated film and for a Independence Day weekend. The opening-week audience was evenly split between adults, teenagers, and children, about 25%–30% of whom were females, although Tri-Star said the figure was higher. The film benefited from repeat viewings by young audience members. One theater chain executive said: \"... nothing since Batman has created the frenzy for tickets we saw this weekend with Terminator. At virtually all our locations, we are selling out ... the word-of-mouth buzz out there is just phenomenal.\" Industry professional Lawrence Kasanoff said it was an \"open secret\" that despite the R rating, children were seeing the film, remarking \"When T2 opened, I saw kids skateboard up to the ticket window ...\"It retained the number-one position in its second weekend, grossing $20.7 million, ahead of the debuts of One Hundred and One Dalmatians ($10.3 million) and Boyz n the Hood ($10 million); and in its third weekend with $14.9 million, ahead of Bill & Ted\\'s Bogus Journey ($10.2 million) and One Hundred and One Dalmatians ($7.8 million). Terminator 2: Judgment Day fell to number two in its fifth weekend, grossing $8.6 million against the debut of the comedy Hot Shots! ($10.8 million). It remained in the top-five highest-grossing films for twelve consecutive weeks and the top-ten highest-grossing films for fifteen weeks. In total, Terminator 2: Judgment Day spent about twenty-six weeks in theaters in a total of 2,495 cinemas, and grossed $204.8 million, making it the highest-grossing film of the year; ahead of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ($165 million), Beauty and the Beast ($145 million), and The Silence of the Lambs ($130 million). This also made it the thirteenth-highest-grossing film of its time, behind Back to the Future (1985), and the highest-grossing R-rated film. The Los Angeles Times estimated after the theater and distributor cuts, the box-office returns to Carolco would be well over twenty percent of the film\\'s cost.Outside the U.S. and Canada, Terminator 2: Judgment Day set numerous box office records. In the United Kingdom it had a record three-day opening weekend of $4.4 million (and a one-week record of $7.8 million) and went on to gross at least $30 million. In France it grossed a record $9.5 million in its opening week (the biggest opening since Rocky IV) and $16 million in two weeks. In Germany it grossed a record $8 million in five days and also had a record Australian opening weekend of $1.9 million. In Thailand it was the highest-grossing western-hemisphere film ever with a gross of $1.2 million. The film also performed well in Brazil and grossed at least $51 million in Japan. Internationally, the film grossed about $312.1 million, making it the first film to gross over $300 million outside of the U.S. and Canada.Terminator 2: Judgment Day is estimated to have grossed a worldwide total of $519–$520.9 million, making it the year\\'s highest-grossing film, and the third-highest-grossing film ever, behind 1977\\'s Star Wars ($530 million) and 1982\\'s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ($619 million).\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day was released to general acclaim. Many reviews focused on the state-of-the-art physical, special, and make-up effects, which were roundly praised as \"revolutionary\" and \"spectacular\", particularly those relating to the T-1000 as a \"technological wonder\". Several publications wrote Cameron\\'s ability to realize cinematic action blockbusters was unmatched; Janet Maslin said at his best, despite occasional lapses into melodrama, Cameron\\'s work is akin to that of director Stanley Kubrick. Both Maslin and The Austin Chronicle commented on the kindness and compassion in the film; The Austin Chronicle contrasted it to the lack of a moral message in The Terminator and Travers described it as a \"visionary parable\" but they, alongside others, criticized Terminator 2\\'s \"muddled\" message about protecting the value of human life and peace by using extreme violence to prevent the use of nuclear weapons, war, and technological reliance.Reviewers generally agreed the narrative early in the film is stronger than the one near the end. Owen Glieberman said the first hour has a genuine \"emotional pull\" and according to Roger Ebert, the initial concept of a boy finding a father figure in a Terminator that is learning to be human is \"intriguing\", but Glieberman said the narrative weakens once Hamilton\\'s character joins the group; Travers and Corliss wrote it stumbles after hours of relentless action and a \"conventional climax\". Despite this observation, Glieberman praised the final battle between the T-1000 and the protagonists. Empire\\'s review and Terrence Rafferty found the film\\'s narrative less satisfying and idea-driven than that of The Terminator; Glieberman said despite it being an effective and witty thriller, Terminator 2: Judgment Day comes across as an expensive B movie when compared with \"visionary spectacles\" such as the Mad Max series and RoboCop (1987). Kenneth Turan said Terminator 2\\'s action scenes succeed without the extreme gore and violence of RoboCop.Ebert and Maslin, among others, appreciated the twist on Schwarzenegger\\'s public action-hero persona by making him a hero who does not kill his enemies; David Ansen and Glieberman found humor in the T-800\\'s non-lethal methods and efforts to become more human-like. Maslin and Hinson agreed, as in The Terminator, Schwarzenegger\\'s role is perfect for his acting abilities; Hinson said Schwarzenegger portrayed more humanity as a machine than he did when portraying normal people. In contrast, Empire suggested the change was a concession to Schwarzenegger\\'s young fans and Peter Travers chose the T-800\\'s death as a \"cornball\" scene that is out of place for the actor and film.Several reviewers praised the T-1000 character for the combination of Patrick\\'s \"chilling\" expressionless performance and the advanced special effects, which create an implacable, \"showstopping\" villain; Empire called the character \"one of the great monsters of the cinema\". Glieberman said the character\\'s absence from much of the film\\'s second act is to the film\\'s detriment, and Hinson wrote the T-1000 lacks any \"soul\" and thus a way for the audience to identify with it. Critics generally agreed Hamilton portrays a \"fierce\" female hero with an impressive physique that lets her outshine another female action hero, Sigourney Weaver\\'s Ellen Ripley in Cameron\\'s Aliens (1986). Other publications found Sarah Connor\\'s narrations about peace to be \"heavy-handed\", overused, and \"unintentionally amusing\". Furlong was praised for giving a natural performance at a young age, and Hinson wrote despite limited screentime, Morton made an impression. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A+\" on a scale of A+ to F.\\n\\nAccolades\\nAt the 1992 Saturn Awards, Terminator 2: Judgment Day received awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director (Cameron), Best Actress (Hamilton), Best Performance by a Younger Actor (Furlong), and Best Special Effects; and a nomination for Best Actor (Schwarzenegger). It also won Favorite Motion Picture at the 18th People\\'s Choice Awards. For the 45th British Academy Film Awards, Terminator 2 received awards for Best Sound (Lee Orloff, Tom Johnson, Gary Rydstrom, Gary Summers) and Best Special Visual Effects (Stan Winston, Dennis Muren, Gene Warren Jr., Robert Skotak), as well as a nomination for Best Production Design (Joseph Nemec III).The 64th Academy Awards earned Terminator 2 four awards; Best Makeup (Winston and Jeff Dawn), Best Sound (Orloff, Johnson, Rydstrom, and Summers), Best Sound Effects Editing (Rydstrom and Gloria S. Borders), and Best Visual Effects (Muren, Winston, Warren Jr., and Skotak), as well as nominations for Best Cinematography (Adam Greenberg) and Best Film Editing (Conrad Buff, Mark Goldblatt and Richard A.

Freeway Scene\"), Best Breakthrough Performance (Furlong), Best Female Performance (Hamilton), Best Male Performance (Schwarzenegger), and nominations for Best Song From a Movie (\"You Could Be Mine\"), Best Villain (Patrick), and Most Desirable Female (Hamilton); as well as a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Cameron and Wisher Jr.)\\n\\nPost-release\\nAftermath\\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day began the careers or raised the profiles of its principal actors. According to industry professionals, Schwarzenegger became the top international star ahead of actors such as Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise. It also marked the start of a lasting friendship between Schwarzenegger and Cameron, who formed a \"midlife crisis motorcycle club\" and reunited for the action film True Lies (1994). Cameron and Hamilton began a romantic relationship in 1991, married in 1997, and later divorced. In 1992 Cameron was given a five-year, $500 million contract by 20th Century Fox to produce twelve films.Furlong became in high demand and Patrick found dealing with his new-found recognition difficult as people asked him to impersonate the T-1000. Despite the film\\'s success, Carolco reported 1991 losses of $265.1 million, which was caused by the financial problems of its other films and subsidiaries; despite investor support, the studio filed for bankruptcy in 1995 and its assets, including Terminator 2, were sold to Canal Plus for $58 million.\\n\\nHome media\\nIn December 1991, Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released on VHS and LaserDisc. It was a popular rental in the U.S. and Canada; a record 714,000 copies were shipped to retailers and it became the best-selling rental by mid-January 1992. A \"Special Edition\" featuring a 15-minute extended version of the film that restored deleted scenes and included interviews with cast and crew, storyboards, designs, and other unrestored deleted scenes, was released on LaserDisc in 1993. Cameron stated he did not use the label \"Director\\'s Cut\" because he considered the theatrical releases to be definitive and the extended versions as opportunities to restore \"depth and character made omissible by theatrical running time\". The theatrical version was released on DVD in 1997. In 2000, an \"Ultimate Edition\" DVD was released, containing the theatrical and \"Special Edition\" cuts, and a new \"Extended Cut\", containing a further scene of the T-1000 inspecting John\\'s bedroom, and the aforementioned alternate ending. Terminator 2 special effects coordinator Van Ling supervised the release. The \"Extreme Edition\" was released in 2003, featuring the theatrical and \"Special Edition\" cuts, a remastered 1080p image, Cameron\\'s first commentary, and a documentary about the film\\'s legacy to special effects.Terminator 2 was released on Blu-ray in 2006; this was followed in 2009 by a \"Skynet Edition\" that contains the theatrical and \"Special Edition\" cuts, and commentaries with the cast and crew. This release includes a limited collector\\'s set containing the Blu-ray; the \"Ultimate\" and \"Extreme\" editions on DVDs; a digital download version; all extant special features; and a 14-inch (360 mm) T-800 skull bust. A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version that includes a standard Blu-ray and digital version, was released in 2017; this release also offered a collector\\'s option that includes one of 6,000 life-size replicas of a T-800 skeleton forearm, each signed by Cameron and individually numbered, the soundtrack, the theatrical, \"Special\", \"Extended\", and 2017 3D remaster cuts, and \"Reprogramming the Terminator\", a documentary that includes interviews with Schwarzenegger, Cameron, Furlong, and others.In 1991 Varèse Sarabande released Fiedel\\'s score, which spent six weeks on the Billboard 200 record chart, peaking at number 70. The theme song \"You Could Be Mine\" peaked at number 29 on the U.S. Billboard 100, and performed well in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Spain, and Canada.\\n\\nOther media\\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day was marketed with numerous tie-in products, including toys, puppets, trading cards, jigsaw puzzles, clothing, a perfume named \"Hero\", and a novelization by Randall Frakes that expands on the film\\'s ending. In 1991 Marvel Comics adapted the film into a comic book, which was followed by expansions of the Terminator 2 narrative, including Malibu Comics\\'s \"Cybernetic Dawn\" and \"Nuclear Twilight\" (1995–1996); Dynamite Entertainment\\'s \"Infinity\" and \"Revolution\" (2007); and the T2 novel series by S. M. Stirling in the early 2000s. Several video-game adaptations of Terminator 2 were published; these include a pinball machine and an arcade game in 1991; the arcade game was popular enough to be ported to home consoles as T2: The Arcade Game. Multiple studios developed adaptations for home consoles; these widely differing games include Terminator 2 for Game Boy and Terminator 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES); the NES version was ported to Game Gear and Sega Master System in 1992. A later adaptation was developed for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and a different game was published for home computers. Merchandise for Terminator 2: Judgment Day was estimated to have generated $400 million in sales.In 1996 T2-3D: Battle Across Time, a live-action attraction, was opened at Universal Studios Florida, and later at locations in Hollywood and Japan). The twenty-minute attraction was co-written and directed by Cameron and cost $60 million to produce, including live-action stunts and a $24 million, 12-minute, 3D film starring Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, Patrick, and Furlong as their in-world characters, making it the most-expensive film per minute. In it, Sarah and John attempt to stop Cyberdyne, which has developed Skynet. They are confronted by the T-1000 but saved by the T-800, which returns to 2029 with John to defeat Skynet and its latest creation, the T-1000000.\\n\\n3D remaster\\nCameron oversaw a year-long 3D remaster and subsequent 2017 theatrical re-release of Terminator 2: Judgment Day in August 2017. Cameron said: \"If you\\'ve never seen it, this\\'ll be the version you want to see and remember\". Cameron made visual modifications to the film to fix errors that had bothered him, including the addition of windshield glass to the T-1000\\'s truck, which fell out during its stunt fall and reappears in later scenes; concealing the obvious use of stuntmen for Furlong and Schwarzenegger during the same scene, concealed more of Patrick\\'s nudity during his introduction, and brightened the visuals. The 3D remaster\\'s theatrical release was seen as a disappointment, earning about $562,000 in its debut across 386 theaters compared to the 3D re-release of Cameron\\'s Titanic in 2012, which fetched $17 million.\\n\\nThemes and analysis\\nFamily and humanity\\nA central theme of Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the relationship between John Connor and the T-800 that serves as a surrogate for the father (Kyle Reese) he never knew. Cameron said: \"Sure, there\\'s going to be big, thunderous action sequences, but the heart of the movie is that relationship\", comparing it with the Tin Man getting a heart in The Wizard of Oz. Both Terminator 2 and Cameron\\'s earlier film Aliens focus on compassion and parental figures; Aliens\\' central character Ripley serves as a surrogate mother to an orphaned girl in contrast to an alien queen and her brood, while Terminator 2 depicts the T-800\\'s relentless protection of his ward against the equally relentless T-1000. The T-800 is designed to emulate humans for infiltration purposes but as it grows and evolves, its emotions become real and it learns from John to feel grief. The T-800 chooses to sacrifice its life to ensure the survival of everyone else. In 1991 essayist Robert Bly wrote elderly men were not offering suitable role models for young men, and in Terminator 2, Sarah denounces the many men in her past who failed to be a father for John, except for the T-800. Once its role is complete, the T-800 leaves John for his own good after stating it lacks the emotions John must rely on.While John teaches the T-800 about humanity, his biological mother Sarah has become less human because of her knowledge about the future. Cameron said: \"She\\'s a sad character—a tragic character ... she believes that everyone she meets, talks to, or interacts with will be dead very soon\". This theme of machine-like humans links with Cameron\\'s and Wisher\\'s choice to make the T-1000 appear as a police officer because thematically they believed it represents humans who should have empathy for others becoming more machine-like and detached from their emotions. The SWAT team at Cyberdyne shoots Dyson, an African American, without warning. Cinephilia described Dyson as the most-human character in the film; according to them, he is an intelligent, optimistic family man who represents real-world encounters between police forces and people of color, compared to their encounter with the Caucasian T-800, during which they warn him before opening fire. The 1991 police beating of Rodney King was captured on the same videotape a civilian used to capture the filming of the biker bar scenes.Following her escape from the state hospital, Sarah appears to embrace John but is actually checking him for injuries, forgoing any emotional attachment for the practicality of ensuring his survival and bringing about his destiny as a future leader. The T-800 is portrayed as a better parent than Sarah, offering him undivided attention while Sarah remains distant and focused on the future rather than the present. Philosophy professor Richard T. McClelland notes Sarah acceptance of the T-800 as John\\'s surrogate father is such she leaves it in control of John when she leaves to kill Dyson. Sarah\\'s dream about the nuclear holocaust that will kill six billion people, including her son, incites her to kill Dyson before he can complete the work that will bring about Skynet but when the moment comes, she is unable to fully forsake her humanity and murder him with no emotion. Cameron described this as a question of humanity\\'s worth if we abandon it to win the battle for its existence. Compared to the bleak, nihilistic theme of The Terminator, Terminator 2 emphasizes the concept of free will and the value of human life. Schwarzenegger quoted the film\\'s line \"no fate but what we make\", saying people have control over their own destinies.\\n\\nViolence\\nOn its release, reviewers were critical of Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\'s message about preserving peace through violence; Owen Gleiberman stated \"reckless indifference\" to human life is intrinsic to the film but the T-800 maiming people rather than killing them potentially condemns victims of violence to a life of pain. Cameron described the film as the \"world\\'s most violent anti-war movie\", and said it is about people struggling with their own violent natures. In particular, Cameron had been concerned by the original antagonist T-800\\'s status as a cultural icon and power fantasy as a lethal, unstoppable force of strength and power, and chose to redefine it in Terminator 2, retaining the power fantasy without taking lives. Cinephilia said it is not morally possible to recover from killing people so Terminator 2 is about redeeming the T-800 and Sarah.\\n\\nMasculinity and femininity\\nAfter the success of Aliens, the growth of female-led action films reflected the increase in women assuming non-traditional roles and the division between professional critics—who perceive a masculinization of the female hero—and audiences who embrace characters regardless of gender. The hyper-masculine heroes played by Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Jean-Claude Van Damme were replaced with independent women who are capable of defending themselves and defeating villains in films such Terminator 2 and The Silence of the Lambs. These female characters often perform stereotypical male actions, however, and have muscular physiques rather than feminine, \"soft\" bodies. Professor Jeffrey Brown considers Hamilton\\'s undershirt to be symbolic of typically male action heroes such as John McClane and John Rambo, as well as females displaying masculine traits such as Rachel McLish in Aces: Iron Eagle III.Despite the emphasis on strong femininity, Hamilton\\'s character remains secondary to Schwarzenegger\\'s; Sarah\\'s efforts to defeat the T-1000 fall short until the last-minute intervention of the T-800. Victoria Warren said this allows the female character to be strong enough to be admired but not strong enough to undermine the male protagonist\\'s masculinity. Amanda Fernbach and Thomas B. Byers said the rigid form of the T-800 represents reactionary masculinity that is in direct opposition to the gender-bending T-1000, which represents a post-modern, fluid nature that is outside traditional norms and in opposition to patriarchy and the preservation of the traditional family.\\n\\nAmerican industry and individualism\\nAuthor Mark Duckenfield said Terminator 2: Judgment Day can be seen as an unintended allegory for the decline of United States industries against successful Japanese technology firms with the cutting-edge T-1000 representing Japan against the older, less-advanced T-800. The U.S. industries, which were sometimes seen as villains during the economic boom of the 1980s, are seen as more sympathetic in the face of obsolescence, just as the T-800 is presented as friendlier and still powerful but no longer overwhelmingly so. Duckenfield considers the final scene, which takes place in a steel mill—a place of American industry—symbolic.According to Warren, Terminator 2 reflects Cold War American values that emphasized principles of American culture, in particular individualism and rejection of government intervention. The institutions the film\\'s protagonists should be able to rely on, such as the government, the police, and technology, are the ones attempting to stop them because they do not believe in the protagonists\\' doomsday prophecy.\\n\\nLegacy\\nCultural influence\\nTerminator 2 is considered a highly influential film, setting a benchmark for sequels, action set pieces, and visual effects. Cameron and special-effects supervisor Dennis Muren said the groundbreaking special effects in Terminator 2 demonstrated the possibilities of computer generated effects and without it, effects-focused films such as Jurassic Park (1993) would not have been possible. Various publications have referenced Terminator 2\\'s influence on special effects, describing it as the most important special-effects film since Tron (1982), and began the era of reliance on CGI effects for films such as Jurassic Park and The Matrix (1999). In 2007 the Visual Effects Society, an entertainment-industry organization of visual-effects practitioners, named Terminator 2 as the 14th-most-influential visual-effects film of all time, and the T-1000 is listed by Guinness World Records as the \"first major blockbuster movie character generated using computers\". According to The Guardian, however, the film\\'s \"groundbreaking\" effects led to \"CGI laziness\", a reliance on computer graphics over practical effects, stunts, and craft. A 2014 Entertainment Weekly article said Terminator 2 contributed to the contemporary Hollywood high-budget, science-fiction epic film, and a reliance on turning films into franchises targeted at young audiences and broad demographics. Den of Geek described it as one of the most influential blockbusters since the thriller Jaws (1975). Several filmmakers and creative leads have named it as an influence on their work, including Steven Caple Jr., Ryan Coogler, Kevin Feige, and Hideo Kojima.With a $94–102 million budget, Terminator 2: Judgment Day became the most expensive movie made in its time, and it remains Schwarzenegger\\'s highest-grossing film. Alongside her appearance in The Terminator, Hamilton\\'s Sarah Connor became regarded as one of the greatest and most-influential cinematic female action heroes and an iconic character. Patrick\\'s T-1000 is considered one of the most-iconic and best cinematic villains; Patrick made cameo appearances as the T-1000 in Wayne\\'s World (1992) and Schwarzenegger\\'s Last Action Hero (1993). In Last Action Hero, Stallone replaces Schwarzenegger as the T-800 on the Terminator 2 poster. The T-800\\'s line \"Hasta la vista, baby\" is considered an iconic piece of movie dialogue that is often quoted. Schwarzenegger also used it in speeches during his political career.Terminator 2: Judgment Day has been referenced to in a variety of media, including television, films, and video games. The biker bar scene was recreated for a 2015 advertisement, which featured Schwarzenegger, for the video game WWE 2K16; the bar patrons were replaced with WWE wrestlers.\\n\\nRetrospective assessments\\nSince its release, Terminator 2: Judgment Day has been assessed as one of the greatest films, and one of the best sequels ever made. It is considered equal to or better than The Terminator, and is also regarded as either the best film in the Terminator franchise or second in quality to The Terminator. Terminator 2 is also considered one of the best action films of all time, and one of the best science-fiction films. In 2001 the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Terminator 2 number 77 on its 100 Years ... 100 Thrills list, recognizing the \"most heart-pounding movies\"; and the 2003 list of the 100 Best Heroes & Villains ranked the T-800 character as the forty-eighth-best hero. The 2005 list of the 100 Best Movie Quotes listed the T-800 dialog line \"Hasta la vista, baby\" as the 76th-best quotation; and the 2008 AFI\\'s 10 Top 10 named Terminator 2 as the eighth-best science-fiction film. To mark Schwarzenegger\\'s 75th birthday in 2022, Variety listed Terminator 2: Judgment Day as the best film in his 46-year career.Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes offers a 92% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 84 critics, with an average score of 8.5/10. The website\\'s critical consensus says: \"T2 features thrilling action sequences and eye-popping visual effects, but what takes this sci-fi/action landmark to the next level is the depth of the human (and cyborg) characters.\" The film has a score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 22 critics\\' reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". During Terminator 2\\'s 30th anniversary in 2021, Cameron, among others, said despite using older models of cars, the film\\'s visuals still compare well with contemporary films. Cameron also said Terminator 2 remains relevant because artificial intelligence had become a ubiquitous reality rather than a fantasy. In 2006 Terminator 2 was listed at number 32 on Film4\\'s 50 Films to See Before You Die list, and is included in the film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Rotten Tomatoes lists it as one of 300 essential movies and at number 123 on its list of 200 essential movies. Popular Mechanics and Rolling Stone jointly listed it alongside The Terminator as the third-best time-travel film ever made. Rolling Stone\\'s reader-voted list of the best-sequels ranks Terminator 2 second behind The Godfather Part II (1974); and Empire readers ranked Terminator 2 17th on its 2017 \"100 Greatest Movies\" list.\\n\\nSequels\\nCameron said he had no intentions for further sequels, believing Terminator 2 \"brings the story full circle and ends. And I think ending it at this point is a good idea\". Wisher and Cameron wrote the script with the intention of leaving no option for a sequel. Even so, four sequels followed: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Salvation (2009), Terminator Genisys (2015), and Terminator: Dark Fate (2019), though none replicated the successes of The Terminator or Terminator 2.Schwarzenegger returned for all but Terminator Salvation, while Cameron and Hamilton returned only for Dark Fate, a direct sequel to the events of Terminator 2. Although better critically received than other post-Terminator 2 sequels, Dark Fate is also considered a failure; analysts blamed audience disinterest on the diminishing quality of the series since Terminator 2, and repeated attempts to reboot the series. Fans also criticized Dark Fate\\'s opening scene, in which a T-800 kills Furlong\\'s teenage John Connor; entertainment website Collider wrote this retroactively damages the ending of Terminator 2. A television series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008–2009) also takes place after the events of Terminator 2, and ignores the events in sequels Terminator 3 and beyond.\\n\\nNotes and references\\nNotes\\nCitations\\nWorks cited\\nJournalsAlegre, Sara Martín (June 1998). \"Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mister Universe?

       " 'Swades: We, the People (transl.\\u2009Homeland) is a 2004 Indian Hindi-language drama film co-written, directed and produced by Ashutosh Gowariker. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan, Gayatri Joshi and Kishori Ballal while Daya Shankar Pandey, Rajesh Vivek, Lekh Tandon appear in supporting roles.\\nThe plot was based on two episodes of the series Vaapsi on Zee TV\\'s Yule Love Stories (1994–95) which had Gowariker playing the role of Mohan Bhargav. The story of the lead role setting up a micro hydroelectric project to generate electricity was reported to be inspired by the 2003 Kannada film Chigurida Kanasu which was based on the novel of the same name by Jnanapith awardee K. Shivaram Karanth and Bapu Kuti by Rajni Bakshi. The music and background score was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics penned by Javed Akhtar. \\nSwades was theatrically released on 17 December 2004, and it opened to rave reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Khan, Joshi and Ballal, and the story, screenplay, and soundtrack. However, it emerged as a commercial failure at the box office.\\nAt the 50th Filmfare Awards, Swades received 8 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director (Gowarikar) and Best Music Director (Rahman), and won Best Actor (Khan) and Best Background Score (Rahman).\\nIt was dubbed in Tamil as Desam and released on 26 January 2005, coinciding with Indian Republic Day. Despite its commercial failure, Swades is regarded ahead of its time and is now considered a cult classic of Hindi cinema and one of the best films in Shah Rukh Khan\\'s filmography. Shahrukh\\'s performance in this film is regarded as among the best performances of his career. The film is owned by Red Chillies Entertainment.\\n\\nPlot\\nMohan Bhargava is a non-resident Indian who works as a Project Manager on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) program at NASA in the United States. Mohan came to U. S. for college studies and kept on living there after his parents in India died in a car accident. He keeps worrying about Kaveri Amma, a nanny at his home in Uttar Pradesh who looked after him during his childhood days. After his parents\\' death, Kaveri Amma went to live in an old age home in Delhi and eventually lost contact with Mohan. Mohan wishes to go to India and bring Kaveri Amma back with him to the U. S. Due to the recent success of Phase I of his project, he takes a few weeks off and travels to India. He goes to the old age home but learns that Kaveri Amma no longer lives there and went to a village named Charanpur a year ago. Mohan then decides to travel to Charanpur, in Uttar Pradesh.\\nMohan decides to rent a recreational vehicle to reach the village fearing that he might not get the required facilities there. Upon reaching Charanpur, he meets Kaveri Amma and learns how his childhood friend Geeta (whom he called \"Gitli\" in his childhood) brought Kaveri Amma to stay with her after Mohan\\'s parents died. Geeta runs a school in Charanpur and works hard to improve the living conditions of the villagers through education. However, the village is divided largely by caste and religious beliefs. Geeta does not like Mohan\\'s arrival as she thinks that he will take Kaveri Amma back with him to the U. S., leaving her and her younger brother Nandan \"Chiku\" alone. Kaveri Amma tells Mohan that she needs to get Geeta married first and that it is her responsibility. Geeta believes in women empowerment and gender equality. This attracts Mohan towards Geeta and he too tries to help her by campaigning for education among backward communities and also girls. Mohan befriends villagers Nivaaran and Melaram, and they support him in his campaign. Mohan also wins the attention of Dadaji, a kind village chief.\\nSlowly love blossoms between Mohan and Geeta. Kaveri Amma asks Mohan to visit a nearby village named Kodi, and collect money from a man named Haridas who owes it to Geeta. Mohan visits Kodi and feels pity seeing Haridas\\' poor condition, which is such that he is unable to provide his family with meals every day. Haridas tells Mohan that since his caste profession of a weaver wasn\\'t earning him any money, he shifted to tenant farming. But this change in profession led to his ostracization from the village and the villagers even denied him water for his crops. Mohan understands the pathetic situation and realises that many villages in India are still like Kodi. He returns to Charanpur with a heavy heart and decides to do something for the welfare of the village.\\nMohan extends his leave by three more weeks. He learns that electricity inconsistency and frequent power cuts are a big problem in Charanpur. He decides to set up a small hydroelectric power generation facility from a nearby water source. Mohan purchases all the equipment needed from his own funds and oversees the building of the power generation unit. The unit works and the village gets sufficient, consistent power from it.\\nDadaji\\'s health deteriorates and he passes away. Mohan is repeatedly called by NASA officials as the GPM project he was working on is reaching important stages and he has to return to the U. S. soon. Kaveri Amma tells him that she prefers to stay in Charanpur as it will be difficult for her to adapt to a new country at her age. Geeta also tells him that she will not settle down in another country and she would prefer it if Mohan stay in India with her and Kaveri Amma. Mohan returns to the U.

Gowariker spent considerable time with Pillalamarri and Kuchimanchi, both dedicated Association for India\\'s Development (AID) volunteers. He supposedly visited Bilgaon, an Adivasi village in the Narmada valley, which is the backdrop of the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) movement. The people of Bilgaon are credited with doing 200 person-days of shramdaan (community service) to make their village energy self-sufficient. The Bilgaon project is recognised as a model for replication by the Government of Maharashtra.The film was reported to be inspired by two episodes of the series titled Vaapsi on Zee TV\\'s Yule Love Stories (1993–95). The story of the lead role setting up a micro hydro electric project to generate electricity was reported to be inspired by the Kannada novel Chigurida Kanasu by K. Shivaram Karanth and Bapu Kuti by Rajni Bakshi.\\n\\nThemes\\nMahatma Gandhi\\'s great-grandson, Tushar Gandhi, noted the theme of Gandhism in the film. The name of the main character portrayed by Shah Rukh Khan is Mohan, which was Gandhi\\'s birth name (Mohandas or \"Mohan\"). The film opens with the quotation:\\n\\nHesitating to act because the whole vision might not be achieved, or because others do not yet share it, is an attitude that only hinders progress.\\nGowariker tries to address the lack of scientific temperament and widespread ignorance among the rural folks through the energetic number \"Ye Tara Wo Tara\", where Mohan is seen encouraging the children to experience the fascinating world of stars through his telescope. In a symbolic manner, the song rejects the defunct divisions of caste and class and at the same time, through its protagonist, tries to instill in the audience an appreciation of curiosity and observation.\\n\\nCasting and filming\\nGowariker initially offered Mohan\\'s role to Aamir Khan (who worked in Gowariker\\'s 2001 film Lagaan), but he rejected it because he found the story to be weak. Mohan\\'s role was then offered to Hrithik Roshan, who refused after reading the script. Gowariker then offered Mohan\\'s role to Shah Rukh, who finally accepted it after listening to the story and he started crying during the story\\'s narration. Bhanu Athaiya, an Oscar winner for Gandhi (1982), was the costume designer for the film.\\nSwades was the first Indian film to be shot inside the NASA headquarters and inside the NASA research center at the Launch Pad 39A of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rainfall monitoring satellite known as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) in the film is an actual NASA mission and was launched in 2014.\\nA major part of the film was shot in Menawali, Maharashtra.\\n\\nReception\\nCritical reception\\nThe film received critical acclaim and went on to become a cult classic, and Khan\\'s performance as Mohan Bhargava is considered one of his best to date.Subhash K. Jha of Indiatimes Movies gave the film 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, \"Swades is a unique experiment with grassroots realism. It is so politically correct in its propagandist message that initially you wonder if the Government of India funded the director\\'s dream.\"Mayank Shekhar from Mid-Day gave it 4 stars, stating, \"I cannot think of a better film for the longest that deserved a stronger recommendation for both touring cinemas of India\\'s villages, and plush multiplexes of Mumbai or Manhattan.\"Jitesh Pillai of the Sunday Times of India gave the film 4 stars and said \"After Lagaan, what? The answer\\'s blowing in the wind. Swades! Here\\'s the verdict: This is a gutsy and outstanding film. Welcome back to real, solid film-making.\" He added, \"Swades is undoubtedly the No. 1 movie of the year.\"Shradha Sukumaran of Mid-Day gave it 3.5 stars and said, \"At the end of it, Swades is a far braver film than Lagaan. It could have hit the high note – if it hadn\\'t tried so hard.\"Avijit Ghosh wrote in The Telegraph, \"With its gentle humour, the film acts as an entertaining vehicle for social change. And hopefully, it will do more for positive nationalism than the Union government\\'s Directorate of Audio Visual Publicity (DAVP) ads ever will.\"\\n\\nBox office\\nSwades earned ₹15.25 crore (US$1.9 million) net box office in India. In the overseas market, the film made $2,790,000. It had a lifetime worldwide gross of ₹34.26 crore (US$4.3 million). The film topped the Chennai box office on its opening weekend.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe song \"Dekho Naa\" is a modified version of the song \"Kichchu Tha\" from the film, Baba (2002).\\n\\nOn 27 March 2021, members of United States Navy Band sang \"Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera\" for Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Ambassador of India to the United States and United States Navy Chief of Naval Operations at a special dinner event. The video of the band members singing surfaced on Twitter and received praise and nostalgia from Shahrukh Khan, A. R. Rahman and netizens alike.\\n\\nTamil version\\nThe Tamil soundtrack under the title Desam was composed by A.R. Rahman. All Lyrics were written by Vaali. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 13,00,000 units sold, this film\\'s soundtrack album was the eleventh highest-selling of the year.\\n\\nAwards\\nNational Film AwardsBest Male Playback Singer – Udit Narayan for \"Yeh Taara Woh Taara\"\\nBest Cinematography – Mahesh Aney\\nGlobal Indian Film AwardsBest Actor – Shahrukh Khan\\nBest Newcomer – Gayatri JoshiZee Cine AwardsBest Director (Critics) – Ashutosh Gowariker\\nBest Female Debut – Gayatri Joshi\\nBest Story –  Ashutosh Gowariker\\nBest Sound Re-recording – Hitendra GhoshStar Screen AwardsMost Promising Female Newcomer – Gayatri JoshiStardust AwardsDream Director – Ashutosh GowarikerBollywood Movie AwardsBest Female Debut – Gayatri JoshiFilm Café AwardsBest Actor – Shahrukh Khan50th Filmfare Awards:Won\\n\\nBest Actor – Shah Rukh Khan\\nBest Background Score – A.

       " 'Crows Zero (クローズZERO, Kurōzu Zero), also known as Crows: Episode 0, is a 2007 Japanese action film based on the manga Crows by Hiroshi Takahashi. The film was directed by Takashi Miike with a screenplay by Shōgo Mutō, and stars Shun Oguri, Kyōsuke Yabe, Meisa Kuroki, and Takayuki Yamada. The plot serves as a prequel to the manga, and focuses on the power struggle between gangs of students at Suzuran All-Boys High School. The film was released in Japan on October 27, 2007. It has spawned two sequels, Crows Zero 2 and Crows Explode, as well as a manga adaptation released November 13, 2008.\\n\\nPlot\\nNewly transferred high school senior Genji Takiya (Shun Oguri) arrives at Suzuran All-Boys High School, an institution infamous for its population of violent delinquents. During the freshman orientation assembly, yakuza arrive at the school seeking vengeance on third-year Serizawa Tamao (Takayuki Yamada) for assaulting some members of their gang. The thugs mistake Genji for their target and a brawl ensues on the school field. Meanwhile, Serizawa is visiting his best friend Tatsukawa Tokio (Kenta Kiritani), who has just been discharged from a hospital. Upon returning to the school, Serizawa witnesses Genji defeat the last of the yakuza.\\nThat night, Genji goes to a nightclub he frequents and meets R&B singer Aizawa Ruka (Meisa Kuroki). He then goes to see his father, yakuza boss Takiya Hideo (Goro Kishitani), to whom he proclaims his ambition to conquer Suzuran, a feat which Hideo himself had attempted in his youth, but failed. Genji makes Hideo promise to acknowledge him as his successor should he succeed. The next day, Genji challenges Serizawa to a fight, but is halted by Tokio. He tells Genji that if he really wants to make an impression he should begin by defeating Rindaman, a legendary fighter at the school. After Rindaman refuses his challenge, Genji encounters Katagiri Ken (Kyosuke Yabe), one of the yakuza who\\'d come to the school the previous day. He attacks Genji in retaliation for getting his gang arrested, but is taken down with a single punch. Humbled, Ken goes with Genji to the club where they discuss the latter\\'s plans for Suzuran.\\nFollowing advice from Ken, Genji begins building his army, called \"Genji Perfect Seiha\" (a.k.a. \"GPS\"). Anticipating the brewing conflict, Serizawa also begins recruiting factions for his own cause. Genji succeeds in rallying several strong members, including Tamura Chūta, Makise Takashi, and Izaki Shun. Serizawa is alarmed by Genji\\'s rapid rise to power, but chooses not to take action. One of Serizawa\\'s lieutenants, Tokaji Yūji, is not so ambivalent and begins covertly attacking members of the GPS, severely beating Chūta and putting Izaki in the hospital. The provocations cause tensions between the two armies to rise drastically, but Genji is prevented from acting by Makise. One night, Tokio and Serizawa visit the nightclub and encounter Genji. As Tokio runs interference between the opposing leaders, he suffers a seizure and is rushed to a hospital, where he learns that he has a cerebral aneurysm which requires surgery. Despite initial hesitation about the procedure\\'s 30% success rate, Tokio agrees to the operation.\\nTokaji approaches Bandō Hideto, leader of \"The Front of Armament\" biker gang, with a plan to kidnap Ruka and further aggravate Genji. Elsewhere, yakuza boss Yazaki Jōji orders Ken to kill Genji, disregarding the fact that doing so will incite a war between the yakuza organizations. The task proves to be too much for Ken, who has grown fond of Genji and begins lamenting his decision to become a yakuza in the first place. He decides to inform Takiya Hideo of the plot to kill his son. Genji gets a call from Ruka, who tells him that she is being held hostage by men with skulls on their jackets, and that her captors mentioned the name \"Bandō\". Surmising that her captors are The Armament, Genji gathers the GPS and proceeds to the biker gang\\'s headquarters. A fight ensues, but Genji soon realizes that the men they are fighting are missing their trademark skull patches. Bandō demands an end to fight, revealing that he\\'d ordered the skulls be removed after part of The Armament aligned with Tokaji. After locating Tokaji and saving Ruka, Genji decides it\\'s finally time for war against Serizawa. They decide to fight at 5:00pm the following day, at the same time that Tokio will undergo his operation, with Serizawa believing it will allow him to fight alongside Tokio.\\nThe next day, as the battle begins, the tide seems to be in Serizawa\\'s favor, but after Bandō\\'s faction of The Armament arrives and joins the GPS, the odds are evened out. The fighting continues until only Serizawa and Genji are left standing. Meanwhile, Ken is taken to the harbor to be executed for disobeying the order to kill Genji. Yazaki gives Ken his coat as a parting gift before shooting him in the back. He falls into the water and begins to sink. Genji and Serizawa fight well into the night, and though injured and exhausted, Genji eventually gains the upper hand and triumphs. Clinging to consciousness, Serizawa receives a call from the hospital informing him that Tokio\\'s operation was a success. Back at the docks, Ken suddenly recovers and swims to the surface. He discovers that the coat Yazaki had given to him was bulletproof, and that his \"execution\" was a ploy to allow him to leave the organization and live a different life.\\nSeveral days later, Genji again challenges Rindaman, the final obstacle on his path to ruling Suzuran. Rindaman expresses his belief that Suzuran can never be truly conquered, and that there will always be someone left to fight. The film ends as the skirmish between Genji and Rindaman begins.\\n\\nCharacters\\nGenji Perfect Seiha (GPS)\\nGenji Takiya\\nTakashi Makise\\nChuta Tamura\\nIzaki Shun\\n\\nSerizawa Army\\nSerizawa Tamao\\nTatsukawa Tokio\\nTokaji Yūji\\nTsutsumoto Shoji\\nThe Mikami Brothers (ex-members)\\n\\nThe Front of Armament (Second Year, Biker Gang)\\nBandō Hideto\\n\\nEbizuka Junior High Trio (First Year)\\nKirishima Hiromi\\nHonjō Toshiaki\\nSugihara Makoto\\n\\nUnaffliliated\\nRindaman / Hayashida Megumi\\n\\nCast\\nShun Oguri as Genji Takiya\\nTakayuki Yamada as Serizawa Tamao\\nSansei Shiomi - Yoshinobu Kuroiwa\\nKenichi Endō - Joji Yazaki\\nMeisa Kuroki as Aizawa Ruka\\nKyōsuke Yabe as Katagiri Ken\\nKenta Kiritani as Tatsukawa Tokio\\nSuzunosuke Tanaka as Tamura Chūta\\nSousuke Takaoka as Izaki Shun\\nGoro Kishitani as Takiya Hideo\\nMotoki Fukami as Rindaman / Hayashida Megumi\\nYusuke Izaki as Mikami Takeshi\\nHisato Izaki as Mikami Manabu\\nShunsuke Daito as Kirishima Hiromi\\nYusuke Kamiji as Tsutsumoto Shōji\\nTsutomu Takahashi as Makise Takashi\\nYu Koyanagi as Sugihara Makoto\\nKaname Endo as Tokaji Yūji\\nDai Watanabe as Bandō Hideto\\nRyo Hashizume as Honjō Toshiaki\\nKazuki Namioka as Washio Gōta\\n\\nRelease\\nThe film was released in Japan on October 27, 2007. It was also screened internationally in Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong throughout 2008. The film was released on DVD in the United States on March 31, 2009.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nThe film grossed US$22,036,607 worldwide.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nReviews of the film have been average. Najib Zulfikar of Total Film gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, stating, \"Miike amps it all up to 11 in his inimitable style, as impossibly coiffured pretty boys duke it out and the Yakuza take an interest in the outcome. Sadly, the story’s so overpopulated it’s hard to care who’ll survive to graduate.\" Similarly, David Brook of Blueprint Review gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars indicating, \"Teenage boys will lap up every minute of it (other than the songs which probably won’t appeal to many Westerners) and the lack of obviously ‘bad’ and ‘good’ guys means the conclusion wasn\\'t always going to be clear cut (after an hour or so you can see where its heading though).\"\\n\\nSequels and adaptations\\nThe film was followed by two sequels: Crows Zero 2 (also directed by Miike) in 2009 and Crows Explode in 2014. It was also adapted into a manga illustrated by Kenichirō Naitō and published in Monthly Shōnen Champion magazine.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nCrows Zero at IMDb']"

      "Kung Fu Hustle. Kung Fu Hustle (Chinese: 功夫; lit. 'Kung Fu') is a 2004 Cantonese-language action comedy film directed, produced, co-written by, and starring Stephen Chow. The film tells the story of a murderous neighbourhood gang, a poor village with unlikely heroes, and an aspiring gangster's fierce journey to find his true self. Eva Huang, Yuen Wah, Yuen Qiu, Danny Chan Kwok-kwan and Leung Siu-lung co-starred in prominent roles. The martial arts choreography is supervised by Yuen Woo-ping. Kung Fu Hustle was a co-production between Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese companies, filmed in Shanghai. After the commercial success of Shaolin Soccer, its production company, Star Overseas, began to develop the films with Columbia Pictures Asia in 2002. It features a number of retired actors famous for 1970s Hong Kong action cinema and has been compared to contemporary and influential wuxia films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero. The cartoon special effects in the film accompanied by traditional Chinese music, is often cited as its most striking feature. The film was released on 23 December 2004 in China and on 25 January 2005 in the United States. The film received positive reviews and grossed US$17 million in North America and US$84 million in other regions. It was tenth on the list of highest-grossing foreign-language films in the United States as well as the highest-grossing foreign-language film in the country in 2005. Kung Fu Hustle won numerous awards, including six Hong Kong Film Awards and five Golden Horse Awards. The film was re-released in 3D in October 2014 across Asia and America, marking the tenth anniversary of the film. Plot In 1940s Shanghai, petty crooks Sing and Bone aspire to join the notorious Axe Gang under the leadership of the cold-blooded killer Brother Sum. The pair visit a rundown slum known as Pigsty Alley to extort the residents by pretending to be Axe members. Sing's actions eventually attract the real gang, who confront the villagers. Gang reinforcements arrive but they are all quickly dealt with by three of the slum's tenants: Coolie, Tailor, and Donut, who reveal they are actually kung fu masters.\n",

      "In the United Kingdom at 59th British Academy Film Awards the film was nominated for a BAFTA.In 2011, the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival listed Kung Fu Hustle at number 48 in their list of \"100 Greatest Chinese-Language Films\". The majority of the voters originated from Taiwan, and included film scholars, festival programmers, film directors, actors and producers. In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. Kung Fu Hustle was listed at 50th place on this list. Sequel In 2005, Chow announced that there would be a sequel to Kung Fu Hustle, although he had not settled on a female lead. \"There will be a lot of new characters in the movie. We'll need a lot of new actors. It's possible that we'll look for people abroad besides casting locals\". In January 2013, during an interview, Chow admitted that plans for making Kung Fu Hustle 2 have been put on hold. \"I was indeed in the midst of making the movie, but it is currently put on hold in view of other incoming projects\". Production of Kung Fu Hustle 2 was delayed while Chow filmed the science fiction adventure film CJ7. As a result, Kung Fu Hustle 2 was slated for a 2014 release. By 2017, Chow had already completed The Mermaid and Journey to the West: The Demons Strike Back. Due to his focus on behind-the-scenes production and the fact that he has not made an appearance since CJ7, it was suspected that he had stopped acting. However, Chow clarified that he still wants to act, but has not found a role suited for him. Kung Fu Hustle 2 remains incomplete. In February 2019, during a promo interview for The New King of Comedy, Stephen confirmed that the sequel is in the works. He will direct the movie and possibly cameo in the film, but the story will not be a direct sequel to the first one. Chow explains the sequel will be a spiritual successor to the first one, but set in modern times. Games Online and mobile games In 2004 a promotional flash game was released by Sony Pictures Entertainment on their Japanese website. The game was created by Japanese game developer Point Zero and plays as a point-and-click beat 'em up.\n",

      "The American version of the soundtrack was released on 29 March 2005 by Varèse Sarabande and has 19 tracks, with 14 tracks missing compared to the Asian release.The soundtrack for the trailer was mastered at Epiphany Music and Recording, Inc. in Santa Rosa, California. References to other works Kung Fu Hustle makes references to a wide range of films, animated cartoons, wuxia novels, anime and other sources. The housing arrangement of the Pigsty Alley is similar to that of a 1973 Hong Kong film, The House of 72 Tenants. It is set in a Shanghai Shantytown taking Hong Kong viewers back to their days of hardship but also making the audience in mainland China interested in, as Ho pointed out, \"Chow appropriates Hong Kong's past to address China's current anxieties over rapid modernization and secures the former colony's bond with its semi-reunited motherland-in both emotional and film business terms\". There are two references to Chow's previous film, Shaolin Soccer: When Sing arrives at Pigsty Alley, he plays skilfully with a soccer ball, then says, \"You're still playing football?\". The second reference is the scene in which a clerk beats Sing up on a bus. The clerk also appeared in Shaolin Soccer as the leader of an opposing team who used hidden weapons to beat up the Shaolin soccer team. When Sing challenges a boy in the Pigsty Alley, Sing calls him \"The Karate Kid\", a reference to the 1984 film of the same name. During the altercation between Sing and the hairdresser, the hairdresser states, \"Even if you kill me, there will be thousands more of me!\". This is a reference to a famous quote made by Lu Haodong, a Chinese revolutionary in the late Qing dynasty. The scene in which Sing is chased by the Landlady as he flees from the Alley is a homage to Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, characters in the Looney Tunes cartoons, even including the pursuer's (the Landlady's) ill fate. During the opening scene in which the leader of the Crocodile Gang is killed by Brother Sum of the Axe Gang, in the background a poster for the 1939 film Le Jour Se Lève is visible.\n",

      "Dil Chahta Hai. Dil Chahta Hai (transl. The Heart Desires) is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language comedy drama film written and directed by Farhan Akhtar. It was produced by Ritesh Sidhwani and released under the banner of Excel Entertainment (which Akhtar and Sidhwani co-founded), marking their cinematic debut. The film focuses on a significant transition period in the romantic lives of 3 college-graduate friends (Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna). It also stars Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni and Dimple Kapadia. Dil Chahta Hai was based on Akhtar's diary detailing his trips to Mumbai and New York City, and a story by a friend of his, Kassim Jagmagia, who would ultimately become a creative associate at Excel Entertainment. He started writing the screenplay in 1998 but finished it when the film's principal photography was started two years later. The film was produced on a budget of ₹80 million (US$1.0 million), and filming took place in both India and Australia. It was one of the first films shot in sync sound, with Nakul Kamte and H. Sridhar handling its sound recording. The trio Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, with lyrics penned by Akhtar's father, Javed Akhtar, composed the soundtrack and the background score. Dil Chahta Hai premiered on 10 August 2001. The film performed moderately at the box office, grossing ₹397.2 million (US$5.0 million) after its theatrical run ended. It proved to be a major commercial success in metropolitan areas, but failed in rural areas; its failure in rural areas was attributed to the upper-class, city-oriented lifestyle it presented. It received widespread critical acclaim upon release, with praise for its fresh storyline, direction, soundtrack, cinematography, costumes and the performances of the cast. Several critics noted that it broke new ground by introducing a realistic portrayal of the modern Indian youth. A recipient of several accolades, Dil Chahta Hai won 2 awards at the 49th National Film Awards, including Best Feature Film in Hindi.\n",

      "Rohit is enraged but decides to yield on being told by Shalini that she loves Akash too. Some time later, Sid returns home and calls Sameer up from a hospital. Sameer visits Sid, and at the waiting lounge of the hospital, catches Sid up on their life's events. They discuss the night Sid and Akash fell apart, and Sameer lies to Sid about being unable to contact Akash. The next morning, however, Akash arrives at the hospital to bury the hatchet with Sid. He apologizes to him, and the two hug. Meanwhile, Tara is about to die from liver cirrhosis. The hospital staff approach Sid to inform him, and he speaks with Tara for the last time in her hospital room. She thanks him for being there for her in her final moments and passes away, leaving Sid's love for her unrequited. Six months later, the friends visit Goa for a trip, accompanied by Shalini and Pooja. Sid sees a woman who resembles Tara, and approaches to talk to her. It is implied that she and Sid get together, as the three friends are shown enjoying dinner with their respective partners. Cast Credits adapted from Bollywood Hungama: Production Development Dil Chahta Hai was based on Farhan Akhtar's diary he wrote during his trips to Goa and his month-and-a-half-long stay in New York City in 1996, and a story by a friend of his, Kassim Jagmagia. He originally conceived a story about the romance between Akash and Shalini. He later shared it with his parents (Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani), who immediately liked his idea but suggested several changes. However, he felt the story was not exciting and unusual enough for him and started to develop other characters, including Akash's friends, making his initial idea become the film's subplot. He was quoted as saying that: \"I always wondered what happens to the best friends of the hero after reel number three. Where do they go? When he needs them the most, they are never there.\n",

      "The one-minute-long trailer was released on television and film theatres (along with Aamir's Lagaan) across India to increase audience enthusiasm and publicity from the media. Prior to its theatrical release, a special screening for Indian Home Minister L. K. Advani was held at his house in Delhi. The film premiered at theatres on 10 August 2001 and clashed with Deepak Shivdasani's romantic drama Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke, also starring Zinta in the lead. Dil Chahta Hai was later screened in several film festivals: the 33rd International Film Festival of India, the 14th Palm Springs International Film Festival, and the 11th Austin Film Festival.Dil Chahta Hai was moderately successful at the box office, performing well in metropolitan areas, but failing in rural regions. Trade analysts attributed its commercial performance in rural regions to the city-oriented lifestyle depicted in the film. However, the film ran for more than 50 weeks, thereby becoming a golden jubilee film. It was released on 210 screens in India and grossed ₹9 million (US$110,000) on its opening day. It collected ₹27.7 million (US$350,000) by the end of its first weekend, and ₹57.3 million (US$720,000) after its first week. The film earned ₹332.8 million (US$4.2 million) from the country, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing Indian film that year. Overseas, Dil Chahta Hai was a commercial success, collecting $210,000 in North America and $100,000 in Atlantic countries in its opening first weekend. The film collected ₹16.5 million (US$210,000), and grossed ₹64.4 million (US$810,000) after finishing its overseas theatrical run, making itself the seventh-highest-grossing Indian film of the year. Box Office India estimated it grossed ₹397.2 million (US$5.0 million) internationally.The television premiere of Dil Chahta Hai took place on 17 August 2002 on StarPlus. The film was released on DVD as a single-disc pack in the NTSC widescreen format on 14 December 2007, and the double-disc version was released simultaneously; Spark Entertainment distributed the latter. The film has been accessible for streaming on Amazon Prime Video and Netflix since 18 November 2016.\n",
